      <p>Hello and welcome to the first episode of the No Context Cinema Club, a show where an almost unbelievably unqualified person rewrites film history by creating plots based only on titles and the true, though sometimes disingenuous, clues that I provide him about the real films. Each week we&#x27;ll explore Rob&#x27;s complete ignorance of film history, testing the limits of what is possible to have missed from pop culture during his 30-something years on this planet, and hopefully having some fun along the way. There are two fundamental rules. Firstly, he&#x27;s not allowed to research or Google anything as we go, and secondly, once he&#x27;s locked something in in his plot, there are no takebacks. Will Rob&#x27;s alternative cuts be works of cinematic genius, or simply descend into the insane ramblings of a lunatic? Only time will tell. At the end of each episode, I&#x27;ll score Rob&#x27;s efforts in three areas coherence, entertainment factor, and originality. For our first episode, we&#x27;ll be diving headlong into the 90s action classic, FaceOff. So Rob, would you like to introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about the origins of this podcast?</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">00:54</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>Yes. So a while back you uh mentioned a film called FaceOff, which we&#x27;re going to talk about today. Um and you were humoured by my initial thoughts about what the film was. Um obviously I was incorrect with my initial thoughts, and then you obviously wanted me to come onto a podcast with you so you could mock me generally about my film knowledge.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">01:15</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>Which is a very valuable and insightful idea for the world of podcasting. Pretty much, yeah. In our first section, which we&#x27;ll be calling plot luck, Rob has nothing but the title to work with. So let&#x27;s see what his initial guesswork tells us about the new director&#x27;s cut of faceoff. So have you had any initial thoughts on what face off might be since you first pitched what you assumed it was?</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">01:36</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>So I I obviously know that my original thought wasn&#x27;t quite there. So I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve been thinking about what face-off could be. I&#x27;ve got two thoughts about what it could be. Uh the first one, uh, which was my initial reaction, was based on my knowledge of your love for ice hockey. So when you mentioned face off, my initial thought was that it was an ice hockey-based film. You laughed quite a lot about that. So then my second thought was that it was some sort of film where a character loses their face, referencing uh the office, Dwight Shroots, has a face peeled off and then put onto his face at one point.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">02:09</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>I am familiar with the episode in which that happens. That I think is more of a reference to a film than a reference from the office. But we&#x27;ll let that no, we&#x27;ll let&#x27;s explore that for a second. So Dwight takes the face off the Rosussi dummy, doesn&#x27;t he? Yep. In the episode, and then says he always wonders how realistic it is to do that. I think that&#x27;s probably referencing the silence of the lambs with Anthony Hopkins, but it&#x27;s also possibly a reference to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I suppose, because there&#x27;s a character called Leatherface in that who takes a face off. So either way, I mean I&#x27;m happy with that.</p>
    </div>

  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">02:40</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>Um I&#x27;m referencing a TV show, which is referencing a film which I&#x27;m unaware of.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">02:45</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>That is brilliant, I would say a fair, fair summary of the situation, yes. Yep. Okay, right. So which of those avenues shall we exploit? To be honest, because it was your first thought, I think even though we subsequently know it&#x27;s not correct, I&#x27;d quite like to follow the ice hockey theme if you were happy, but we can we can go with the take taking a face off a person if you prefer.</p>
    </div>

  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">03:06</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>I I feel like I&#x27;ve fleshed out the ice hockey film more in my mind, and obviously it was only an immediate reaction. And I I reckon I reckon there&#x27;s a film there that we could talk about, even if it doesn&#x27;t exist.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">03:16</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>Okay, well, it doesn&#x27;t exist. Um let&#x27;s do this. Okay, so the film in in which we&#x27;re working on here is going to be an ice hockey-based film. Have you got any thoughts about the plot other than it&#x27;s about ice hockey?</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">03:29</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>Well, all films that are about sport have a very similar story arc, and that is that there is some sort of crisis, whether it&#x27;s a a school or a club in crisis or an individual in crisis, and then it&#x27;s basically just redemption arc from there. So I think overall it&#x27;s going to be a redemption story, but it&#x27;s a redemption story for an individual.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">03:50</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>Okay. Uh have you got any thoughts on the individual, the protagonist of this particular story?</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">03:56</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>Yep, I don&#x27;t know the actor&#x27;s name. Oh, yeah, okay. So what we will find over the course of this podcast is that I also don&#x27;t know many many actors and what they&#x27;re in. I&#x27;ve got a weird word association when it comes to film and actors that I just think of random things and then or I associate them with random things, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll refer to. So the actor, I&#x27;ve got I&#x27;ve got a lead actor for the film. I don&#x27;t know his name, so you&#x27;re gonna have to help me with that. I&#x27;ll try. He is the guy that is in Jurassic Park with is the bigger guy that wears a yellow jacket in the rain.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">04:28</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>Oh, out in the rain, okay. Yeah, he&#x27;s the guy that uh ends up getting eaten on the toilet. Does he? He I think he does. I mean, I haven&#x27;t seen Jurassic Park for a while, but I&#x27;m fairly sure. So the guy, I know who you&#x27;re talking about. Um, and he is a guy, he was in Seinfeld, I think, and a comedy called Third Rock from the Sun as Officer Don. But anyway, go on. He&#x27;s he&#x27;s also in Cool Runnings. He okay, he&#x27;s not also in Cool Runnings.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">04:52</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>He is, is is the coach in Cool Runnings?</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">04:54</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>Uh that&#x27;s John Candy, who is another fat guy. Ah, right. Okay.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">04:59</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>So I&#x27;ve mixed up my uh my Hollywood fat guys.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">05:03</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>I I think you might have. Okay, right, but so John so John Candy in Cool Runnings, which is a sport film which features a redemption arc for the main character. I can see where this has uh sort of crept into your consciousness because yeah, John Candy in that film in Cool Runnings is a disgraced Bob Slay coach who cheated when he himself was in the Winter Olympics.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">05:26</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>Right. So something that we should worry about is that my ice hockey film is pretty much that.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">05:31</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>Well, I mean, there&#x27;s similar there&#x27;s ice, uh there&#x27;s a redemption. There&#x27;s not even ice for the character. But I but I you know I think we can work with this. I mean, in face off, you want John you want either John Candy or offers a don from Third Rock from the Sun who also uh gets wears a big yellow jacket in the rain in Jackson.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">05:48</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m sure the guy in uh in Colour Runnings wears a yellow jacket. I know he wears a big duffel.</p>
    </div>
  </article>
  <article class="t-turn">
    <div class="t-time">05:56</div>
    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>In okay. Have you watched Home Alone recently, Rob? Yep, love Home Alone. Okay. I think John Candy wears a yellow jacket in his short cameo appearance in Home Alone when he is, was he, uh I can&#x27;t remember the name of it, but he goes, Polka, polka, polka. He&#x27;s the polka singer. The back of the van. I think they all wear yellow jackets, don&#x27;t they? Um his polka outfit who was trying to get back to Milwaukee or something like that.</p>

    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>He is my main man. Sorry, guy from Third Rock from the Sun, and I think Seinfeld, and I don&#x27;t know your name, I&#x27;m afraid, but John Candy has just beaten you to it in the final casting to be the protagonist of Rob&#x27;s new film Face Off. But don&#x27;t worry, John Candy will be very used to the role because he&#x27;s played it already in Cool Runnings by the sound of it. Although he was much more alive when that was made than he is currently.</p>

    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>Immediate casting issues. Yeah, yes. What I will say is I I was thinking coming into this that my film knowledge was below average, but my TV knowledge was better than average. Okay. So my um my references are gonna be poor at this point, I think.</p>

      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>Well, I mean let&#x27;s explore. So we&#x27;ve got John Candy playing the role of what?</p>
    </div>

      <p>Of course, if it&#x27;s well, or Canada maybe if it&#x27;s I mean, John Candy was Canadian, I believe. So you know, you could be Canadian. No, America. We&#x27;re going to Hollywood, yeah.</p>

Okay, yeah, that&#x27;s maybe wearing a nice uh nice sort of uh um palm tree shirt to the games. Okay, so he&#x27;s he&#x27;s wearing his sort of flamboyant some somewhere not known for the hockey. Okay, well, I mean the Florida Panthers won the Stanley Cup very recently. So this is the problem that your knowledge of hockey is better than mine as well, so it&#x27;s gonna follow me here. So somewhere where it&#x27;s got him in New Mexico. Perfect.</p>

      <p>Not sure yet. Okay, he&#x27;s definitely done something which has shamed himself, and he&#x27;s essentially on the run in hiding, and he&#x27;s not been able to take his his amazing job up at the NHL, and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s had to go and the only job he can get is uh a really down on its look middle school hockey team in Arizona. Okay, a ragtag bunch of misfits. Yeah, nobody wants to play hockey, they&#x27;re all they&#x27;re all out enjoying the the desert, I suppose.

      <p>He doesn&#x27;t want to be there, and the hockey team. I&#x27;ve got a vague reference of something I&#x27;ve seen on TikTok where a basketball coach goes and he causes a bit of trouble at the school he goes to, it&#x27;s a high-flying basketball team, and he he comes and messes things up by requiring certain grade point averages and stuff like that.

      <p>In our next section called The Plot Thickens, I&#x27;ll be feeding Rob some more information about the real film face-off, um, which he&#x27;s going to be forced to include within his own already slightly derivative plot. So here we go. The first thing I&#x27;ve got for you, Rob, is that in the real film face-off, the hero does assume a new identity.</p>

      <p>Right, okay. So my main character who is played by John Candy. By John Candy. Uh it&#x27;s a coincidence that because he&#x27;s called John in the film as well.</p>

      <p>So um what I didn&#x27;t say in the first section was that actually that it&#x27;s quite a bit of court case he&#x27;s going through, and as part of that, he&#x27;s under a bit of pressure. So part of his move to uh Phoenix, Arizona, um is part of the witness protection programme, actually. So he&#x27;s taken up a totally new life. So he&#x27;s obviously working through his skill sets that he&#x27;s got, but um, he has left his whole life behind and he&#x27;s now called John.</p>

      <p>Now called John. Right, we don&#x27;t know what he was called before. That&#x27;s okay, we don&#x27;t need to worry about that. He&#x27;s in witness protection. Why would we know what he was called before? Right. Uh can I just clarify, we&#x27;re in Phoenix, Arizona, aren&#x27;t we? I said New Mexico earlier. You weren&#x27;t happy with that. No, we moved him to Phoenix, Arizona, that&#x27;s all good.</p>

      <p>Yeah, so do you remember back in the 90s when Premier League managers were accused of tapping up players? Oh, yes, of course. He was doing that, but with sponsors and he was taking kickbacks. He was he was found guilty of taking kickbacks, but there was a lot of money involved, and people went missing. It got a little bit a little bit dirty, a little bit nasty, and that&#x27;s when he was uh relocated. Hang about. Can you guys can you guilty? Why is he in witness protection? Can you be guilty of the city? Why is he in witness protection then? If he&#x27;s already been found guilty of this crime? Sorry, there&#x27;s an ongoing trial. Sorry, there&#x27;s an ongoing trial. He&#x27;s presumed guilty. You misspoke. Misspoke, yeah. Like he probably did in court, I imagine. He&#x27;s a nervous guy. Um he is under a trial and there&#x27;s risk to his life, and for that reason he&#x27;s in witness protection while under suspicion.</p>

      <p>Well, under suspicion, so maybe he&#x27;s done it, maybe he hasn&#x27;t. Yeah, but we all know he&#x27;s guilty. Okay, we know he&#x27;s alright, fine. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s clear in his arc that he has to so far, yeah. Okay, alright. So that explains why uh the hero gets a new identity. That&#x27;s good. Um I&#x27;ve got a quote from uh face off that I picked up when I rewatched it last week for this. Um in this he actually says when all else fails, fresh tactics.</p>

      <p>Perfect. And this fits right into the rest of the film. Because what we&#x27;ve not talked about is actually his day-to-day job in Phoenix or or what he does on a day-to-day basis. He&#x27;s obviously gone to this middle school and he&#x27;s started to coach them ice hockey. They&#x27;re not very keen on it, obviously, they&#x27;re in the middle of a desert, they don&#x27;t have an ice hockey rink, he has to do fundraisers. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m thinking this too as I&#x27;m talking about. They don&#x27;t have a ring, he has to do fundraisers. How have they given him a job? Why have they taken him on as a coach? They&#x27;re a high school who&#x27;ve just got funding for an ice hockey team, and he has to go and help raise more funds to build a rink and start the program kit and all that. So he has to get the kids on board, he has to convince the school they need to go bigger and better, the parents can&#x27;t be bothered. Wow. That&#x27;s where his starting point was. But he&#x27;s actually a really good coach.</p>

It all goes back there in there. That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s quite an elaborate opening sequence, and then it turns out it&#x27;s just um Andy or something playing with his toys. Right. So the next the next part of information I&#x27;ve got for you um is going to involve a relatively lengthy impression. And I&#x27;d just like to point out now that I&#x27;m doing an impression as a stylistic or kind of artistic choice, and it&#x27;s in no way related to uh a basic lack of understanding of intellectual property law.</p>

      <p>I didn&#x27;t know we were doing impression. Well, I mean, get ready. Um I would like to point out so in actuality, and I I&#x27;m not gonna say too much about the actual film of Face Off, but it is possibly one of the most outrageously overacted movies that I have ever seen. You might have seen The Mask, surely you&#x27;ve seen the mask with Jim Carrey. Yeah. Okay. In that, he&#x27;s very deliberately overacting, yeah? Yeah. So in this, they&#x27;re just acting like that. Uh but anyway, so I&#x27;ve got a quote for you, and I think I think we were able to easily and seamlessly fit in this in, but here we go.</p>

      <p>You&#x27;re asking me to break the law, risk my neck, and you&#x27;re asking me to put in the dark all the people that love me and trust me. I&#x27;ll do it. Uh, where does that fit into the film? Firstly, I am flawed by that act, which is great.</p>

      <p>I mean, I th I think this is pretty obvious where it fits into the film. It&#x27;s um it obviously calls back to the initial court case that&#x27;s going on, and obviously we know he&#x27;s got a new love interest, but he has left loved ones behind, not necessarily a partner, but he has left friends and family and and ex-colleagues, and they&#x27;re obviously embroiled in some of their fraudulent issues that he&#x27;s facing um that cost him his job in the NHL.</p>

      <p>Yeah, okay. Well, I mean, and once again, I&#x27;m just gonna dive back to the original face-off because this really stood out for me, that quote, um, just with a pure, complete level of selfishness, where he only talks about all the people that love me and trust me, and he doesn&#x27;t make any reference to his own feelings about them whatsoever. It&#x27;s all about oh, you&#x27;re asking me to do this to the people who love me. Um, not to the people he loves, but the people who love him. So he&#x27;s I think he&#x27;s got a slightly selfish side. Um, how do we square that circle?</p>

      <p>I I think your painting, John, is quite a one-dimensional character there. I think actually the move, the big the move to the big city, to the movement to Phoenix, has actually brought out a softer side, and he&#x27;s actually more of a community man. So he&#x27;s obviously learnt his lesson from uh his his past trials, I&#x27;d imagine.</p>

      <div class="t-speaker speaker-kev">Kev</div>
      <p>Okay, all right. Well, I mean it it fits. So we&#x27;ve managed to put in some genuine details from FaceOp into your film almost seamlessly. Um, there have there there are a couple more that we could throw in there if you like. Would you like to explain, for example, why at one point he then says, Dress up like Halloween, and ghouls will try to get. Your pants. You got everything for that.</p>

    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>That is left field. When you started talking about dress up for Halloween, I was I was obviously going to refer back to some of the fundraising the school did, but uh Ghoul&#x27;s getting in his pants is a bit of a left field um introduction. I suppose he&#x27;s he&#x27;s obviously he&#x27;s obviously talking to his new love interest. Of course, of course. He&#x27;s uh he&#x27;s trying to tell her the problems he&#x27;s going through, but it is in the the the the law, the the the law issues he&#x27;s got the legal issues he&#x27;s got. So it&#x27;s a metaphor. He&#x27;s trying to tell her that how much he&#x27;s struggling without telling her he&#x27;s in witness protection. And that is his way of of expressing his so is he currently dressing up like Halloween?</p>

      <p>He&#x27;s always dressing because he&#x27;s having in the film, he&#x27;s just constantly dressed up as a zombie in scene one later, he comes back and like a decapitated head. No, it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just obviously the the uh is his witness protection bit him dressed up like Halloween.</p>

      <p>Okay, alright. So that works. One more then. And I think this will be easy. He does spend a spell of face-off in a maximum security prison. Does he? He does. Well, John Candy doesn&#x27;t think he&#x27;s not in it, but but maximum security.</p>

      <p>Witness protection worthy. Um so so I I&#x27;ve harked back to him, the opening scene of him being on playing with his uh playing with the plane and on the runway. Well, that&#x27;s where we actually start the film, but we do have flashbacks to his previous time and part of his struggles and part of the depth of John as a character is that all the way through he&#x27;s got this real positive surge of energy coming from the middle school and his new love interest, and everything that&#x27;s going well in his life.</p>

      <p>It&#x27;s really working out. He&#x27;s found his calling. Absolutely, you&#x27;d say so. Although he still he still harks back to his days of of potential glory and getting to the big time.</p>

      <p>Absolutely, but he can never do that again because of his situation. We do get flashbacks uh when he&#x27;s really struggling, and I think he&#x27;s probably got an underlying drink problem. Of course he does. And when he&#x27;s when he&#x27;s had a bit too many, uh a few too many, uh, these callbacks to his previous uh his previous life, and once he was arrested for his fraud, he was obviously taken to prison. And and you as a you as a viewer, you&#x27;re watching it thinking, you just want him to get better, uh his mental health, so we can we can really make the most of his new life down in Phoenix.</p>

      <p>Okay, well, I mean I mean I think that&#x27;s that you know all fits. It&#x27;s a beautiful film we&#x27;re constructing here. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much like the original, um, but that&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m not going to ask you to shoehorn in a chemical weapon that threatens LA. Because although we&#x27;re in the right sort of part of the USA for it, I feel like that might be a step too far. Um, I would like to explore why you think this film would be called face off. I know that I get there&#x27;s the ice hockey bit, but presumably there&#x27;s something a bit deeper as to why it&#x27;s called face-off. Um it sounds like maybe there isn&#x27;t much. Um I mean, is the court case unresolved? Yes, it&#x27;s ongoing. So is is the face-off actually a legal face-off as well?</p>

      <p>Well then so what I suppose really the next question is how does this film end? Like you said. Like what what are we building to? Because generally speaking, a story has has some form of resolution, whether or not it&#x27;s happy, that you know, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of by the way, and you&#x27;re the uh you&#x27;re the director here. So what are we building towards?</p>

    <div class="t-content">
      <div class="t-speaker speaker-rob">Rob</div>
      <p>And and this film is heartbreaking. Oh, is it it&#x27;s heartbreaking because we&#x27;ve talked about the success he&#x27;s having all the way through his new life in Phoenix. And we know there&#x27;s an ongoing court case, and that court case actually finds him innocent.</p>

      <p>And this is the big moral dilemma on the last on the last scene, the last few scenes is his mini his team&#x27;s hockey. Oh no, they haven&#x27;t reached a final. I promise they&#x27;ve reached a final. But it&#x27;s on the same day as the big trial. Oh, of course. And he has got to choose does he want to continue with his new life, little league hockey team, yeah, his new love interest, or does he want to go back and clear his name? Right. His one chance to do that. One chance, one shot, and potentially get back in the big time in NHL.</p>

      <p>Well, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s quite derivative in a number of areas, but I feel like the ending, I mean, he&#x27;s gone and he&#x27;s cleared his name and he&#x27;s left the team. He doesn&#x27;t reappear at the 11th hour for kind of a in the final period he turns up and they&#x27;re all looking his way and they&#x27;re pleased or anything like that. Nope. They maybe they keep looking for him, and we&#x27;re expecting as an audience, we&#x27;re expecting him to walk in the tunnel, but instead he&#x27;s just gone to the bar.</p>

      <p>No, I don&#x27;t know. There&#x27;s I like that, and then actually he&#x27;s is just at an NHL game. Yeah, just sitting he&#x27;s been shmoozed by the CEO of some uh hockey team and he&#x27;s gonna get his job back. Nice, hot dog on a beer, sat back. And that the only time the people from Phoenix ever see him again is on the TV.</p>

      <p>Yeah. So, well, as I said, derivative in many ways, but I think the ending probably wouldn&#x27;t be a classic sort of happy ending there. But I quite like the way you&#x27;ve reimagined face off. I suppose now it comes down to the scoring, which starts with this. We did talk about the three particular areas where we&#x27;d be scoring, and they were coherence. I mean, it it does actually plausibly fit together quite nicely.</p>

      <p>Name one plot hole. I mean, the the the ghouls in your pants Halloween bit is a bit tenuous. I&#x27;m really not sure about the made-up plain start because that that that feels like it belongs in a story where actually he does end up having some value or meaning for the child.</p>

      <p>There we go. That clarifies that. Well, in which case the coherence score can shoot right up. Um I I think you did a very good job actually of shoehorning in a whole bunch of different things. I did pick some quite friendly elements.</p>

      <p>Yeah, well, you know. But also, that&#x27;s why I feel that it lacks a bit of coherence because I just don&#x27;t see that they would have had a 15-minute section of that in the film if it was really such a trivial part. So I&#x27;m going to score you six for coherence. Out of what? Uh 10. Everything&#x27;s going to be arbitrary out of. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to no, I&#x27;m going to make it seven. I&#x27;ll give you seven for coherence on it. Because actually, there was there was a there was a redemption arc. It didn&#x27;t end quite how I expected. Um, but that&#x27;s good. Entertainment factor. It depends on how good the action scene is at the start, to be honest. Um I think uh Rubbish, okay. Well, you haven&#x27;t really solved it. Um what about the the sort of it is it an emotional tugs at the heartstrings in the in the main element of it? I can see that it would be quite uh emotionally engaging watching his redemption arc.</p>

      <p>How do they make it to the final? Let&#x27;s not worry about how they make it to the final because that&#x27;s we&#x27;re just gonna lose coherence if we if we do that. Entertainment factors. You have lowered that massively by focusing on the sponsorship angle. So, entertainment factor, I&#x27;m going with five. And you&#x27;re and you&#x27;re lucky to get five, frankly. Um, originality.</p>

      <p>Oh, can I score this? Go on, because I&#x27;ve watched very few films, and this is. And all of them are referenced in this one. All of them are referenced in this one, and it is a solid three. There is nothing in there that hasn&#x27;t happened in Hollywood before.</p>

      <p>Well, no, but I mean we&#x27;re we&#x27;re not gonna hold you to that sort of start. You know, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re gonna have to be any any sort of Guillermo del Toro. Not that you know that doesn&#x27;t matter. Okay, well, I would I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll give you four for original just because the curveball at the end where he never goes back. You we&#x27;re expecting, you know, if it follows the standard tropes of a kind of sports coach little league kind of thing, he goes back and they win the game somehow, or at least he goes back and consoles them and they all learn a lesson, but instead he just cuts them off. Um which is brutal, but I but quite original. Um so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s hit that for a five. A five? Yeah, five. What&#x27;s in total? Uh I&#x27;ve already forgotten what the other numbers were. Brilliant. Adherence, I think maybe seven entertainment five and originality five. So you&#x27;ve got seventeen. I say we&#x27;re for half marks. That is 17 out of 30. A high bar. It is well, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a generous bar. We&#x27;ll call it a generous bar. For next week, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s gonna get we&#x27;re doing this again. Uh well, maybe how many films do you know about? I know about quite a few. The real question is how many films could I find that you don&#x27;t know enough about, I suppose. A lot. Um the the next one, actually, on my mind, and I don&#x27;t know how much you know about this film, is a film called Goodwill Hunting. Any any sort of knowledge of that?</p>

      <p>Okay, perfect. So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve got an initial reaction. Oh. Would you care to share any of that? Do you want to know my initial reaction to that? Or should we save that? We&#x27;ll save that for next time. We&#x27;ll save that for next time, otherwise people will think it&#x27;s all scripted and we wouldn&#x27;t want that, would we? Um at least that&#x27;s what it says in the script here. Right, okay, so I think we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve covered face off um in the no context cinema club, and I I really quite enjoyed it. So 17 out of 30, not a bad start to your directorial career.</p>

      <p>So, Kev. Now, we&#x27;ve just spent the last half an hour or so talking about my lack of knowledge about films. But I I actually think my lack of knowledge about films is just is just because I&#x27;ve just not got any interest in films as such. Okay. So I think it&#x27;s just a normal lack of knowledge. It&#x27;s not special. I don&#x27;t know.</p>

      <p>So so anyway, I I think my lack of knowledge will be subsequent to your lack of knowledge in in some pretty pop culture things. Okay, alright. So I I&#x27;ve begged you for a section at the end of the podcast to try and I don&#x27;t know exactly what the section is going to be. And it&#x27;s gonna be unscripted. Okay, well, good. Yeah, good. And it&#x27;s gonna be different probably every time we do it. Okay. But I&#x27;ve got a little quiz for you about something which I think is incredibly popular, which I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll know about. Okay, all right. And that&#x27;s Doctor Who. Uh okay then, yes, you&#x27;re correct. So I&#x27;ve got three questions which I think have entered the public consciousness in the last two decades.</p>

      <p>He is not one of my questions. Okay, well, good, good, good. But I reckon over the last two decades or so, these three things have entered public consciousness. Okay. And I want I want to basically prove to you that you&#x27;ve got as much of a gap with TV shows as I do with films. Alright. Just in three questions, I&#x27;m not gonna make you write a whole plot. So, question one, and this is multiple choice. Oh, okay. Well, do I do I have to have the options? I will give you the options. Okay, alright. Um, what is the name of the doctor&#x27;s time machine? You don&#x27;t have to have the options. That&#x27;s the TARDIS. Oh, worrying. So that no is it you would think I would not know that. They get more difficult. I knew you&#x27;d know that.</p>

      <p>I think way more than we would see on the street. This is a good conjecture, isn&#x27;t it?</p>

      <p>Yeah. So so that is if you go on Etsy, by the way, and search Doctor Who, you can get Fish, Fingers, and Custard on everything. Oh, okay, alright. So it&#x27;s a thing. It&#x27;s not just me. Fish, fingers, and custard. It&#x27;s quite a big thing. So question three, and this is the last one, it&#x27;s multiple choice again. So this is around the highest rated episode on of Doctor Who according to IMDB users. Call back to before. This is when I had to Google IMDb. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re on IMDb, then. So um the Doctor, this is a question about the highest rated episode. So the doctor sends a cryptic message back through time to help his friends survive an encounter with the weeping angels. What is his key instruction? Is it stay in the light? Is it avoid mirrors, or is it don&#x27;t blink?</p>

      <p>Or weeping angels. Stay in the light. I can believe that would work. Avoid mirrors. Avoid mirrors. And the third one&#x27;s blink. Don&#x27;t blink. Weeping angels. I will go with stay in the light, please.</p>

      <p>And again, you&#x27;re wrong. This is great news for me. Terrible. So I got 17 out of 30, which was way over 50%, and you&#x27;ve got one out of three, which is under 50%. So I think it&#x27;s kind of proved my point that my knowledge isn&#x27;t as bad as potentially you think it is.</p>

      <p>Well, I think that our lengthy exploration of face off suggests otherwise. But we can find out next time when by the sounds of it, we might be exploring Goodwill Hunting instead. I am looking forward to it. Excellent. Well, thank you very much for your time. Bye.</p>
