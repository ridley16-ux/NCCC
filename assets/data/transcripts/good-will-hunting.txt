Kev: 00:00
Hello and welcome back to the No Context Cinema Club, the show where an increasingly bewildered host discovers the true depths of the black hole of knowledge that one man can have about classic movie heritage. That man is Rob, and he's here with me again after last week rewriting the nineties action blockbuster face-off as a run-of-the-mill sports redemption story. Each week we'll be exploring a different movie, with Rob creating an alternate cinematic universe, one feature film at a time. With each new amendment to film history, I'll score his efforts against three criteria coherence, originality, and entertainment factor.

Rob: 00:28
Hello, Rob. Hi, Kev. Nice to be back.

Kev: 00:31
Have you had a chance or did you feel compelled to watch last week's feature film, Face Off?

Rob: 00:36
Uh no to both.

unknown: 00:37
Okay.

Kev: 00:38
Do you think you're likely to?

Rob: 00:39
Absolutely not.

Kev: 00:41
In which case I will give you a brief rundown so you know just how inaccurate you were.

Rob: 00:45
Are you saying what I did wasn't correct?

Kev: 00:47
It was it it shared very little in common with the real film. Uh John Candy, sadly, not in the real face-off either, although I probably would have been better for it. I think I mentioned last week that it was one of the most outrageously overacted movies ever seen. Those two overactors were John Travolta and Nicolas Cage.

Rob: 01:04
I know both of them actors.

Kev: 01:06
You know them personally, or just sort of dimly through a photograph?

Rob: 01:10
One of them personally and the other one I've heard of.

Kev: 01:12
Marvellous. Well, the premise of the film, Rob, was not indeed a sports redemption arc, um, but rather that at the very start of the film, the bad guy, an international terrorist called Castor Troy, uh attempting to assassinate cover anti-terrorist cop accidentally kills his son instead whilst shooting him. Is that on the plane? No, no, that's just before the plane. Just before the plane. So wronged cop Sean Archer, played by Dron Travolta, for some of it, then obviously uh has it has his life's mission to really go and take down this bad guy, Castor Troy, played initially by Nicolas Cage.

Rob: 01:51
Do I have to remember any of this? Nope.

Kev: 01:53
None of it at all. Then there's a big plane uh kind of chase, as we talked about, the FBI guy commandeers numerous vehicles, uh, starts trying to fly a helicopter, all that kind of stuff. Castor Troy or Nicolas Cage is an exuberant international terrorist who I would say has a slightly troubling penchant for uh sexual harassment that goes unchallenged throughout the film. Um it's pretty grim. Sean Archer himself has a rebellious teen daughter who dresses up like Halloween, hence the ghouls trying to get into her pants. So that's where that sort of comes from. Uh the main part of it being called face-off, of course, happens when the terrorist is captured, almost killed. They think he's basically dead, but he's on life support. He's already set a chemical weapon to detonate over LA a week in the future. So what other option does John Travolta have than to accept radical facial surgery? They remove the face of Nicolas Cage. Yes, they do. I know this sounds more ridiculous than the your story. They remove the face of Nicolas Cage, put it on to John Travolta, give him a little microchip in his throat so that he suddenly sounds magically uh like Nicolas Cage, uh, and then drop him into a maximum security prison to pose as the terrorist, get the information about where the um the bomb is set and held from his brother, who's been captured, uh, and then extract him, of course, and save the day. But oh no, what should happen? Foolishly, they've kept Nicolas Cage alive. He wakes up without a face, naturally, of course, because they've taken it off, captures some sort of nondescript character that we never really see again, forces them to call in the surgeon who did the original surgery and put John Travolta's face on him. So he is now posing as the the anti-terrorism cop.

Rob: 03:49
Right.

Kev: 03:49
Of course, he burns all records of anything that had ever happened, so there's no record that they have swapped places whatsoever. And who's going to believe a guy in a maximum security prison claiming to have had his face swapped? To see where this is going. And of course, much uh terrible things could sort of ensue as poor old uh Sean Archer, originally played by John Travolta but now being played by Nicolas Cage, tries to recover his old life, and that that's why it's called FaceOff, but it doesn't sadly feature John Candy.

Rob: 04:20
That is weird. If I'd have come last week and said that, you'd have kicked me out, obviously.

Kev: 04:26
And I don't know if you're winding me up because genuinely, so that puts us both in that position because I think you might be winding me up in a long term, very long-term wind up about how little you know, but I'm not convinced. But it is pretty mad that that is indeed the full well, not the full plot, there's more happens after that. But that's a kind of that's that's the gist of it. And you can see basically what an insane film it is. I think mine was better. Well, I'm not sure about better, but possibly more coherent. If I'd done the coherence and uh entertainment, well, the coherence part your score would have scored higher. Absolutely. Um Entertainment Factor, not so much after you face really focusing on that that montage of sponsorship money or whatever it was.

Rob: 05:04
That might appear again today in one of the things. Excellent. I look forward. But that it's called face-off literally because they take his face.

Kev: 05:11
Yeah, and there's a great moment where um one of the currencies goes, I want to take his face off.

Rob: 05:18
Brilliant.

Kev: 05:18
And the other guy goes, You want to take his face off?

Rob: 05:22
And he goes, I want to take his face off. Just the three times he mentioned face off.

Kev: 05:27
And then uh then the other guy goes, No more drugs for that man. And that's very much how I feel or how I felt at large parts of last week's podcast. Anyhow, so that's the quick rundown. Do you want to watch last week's podcast? Are you now likely to watch that movie? Well, not even I mean, there's some look, I wouldn't recommend anybody goes up and watches face off, really. It's I mean, I enjoyed it at the time 30 odd years ago. I'm not saying anyone should dig into the annals of film history to go and watch face off. But if you're if you were an enjoyer at the time, go and have another look at it, obviously. It was of its time. It was a classic 90s blockbuster. It's not winning any awards.

Rob: 06:05
It's likely something they'll probably reboot in the next couple of years.

Kev: 06:09
That is entirely possible. Yeah, I can absolutely see it. Yeah, face off again. That's better already. Um yeah, face off again. Okay, I won't ru ruin the ending just in case you do watch it, but uh yeah, I wouldn't recommend it really. However, moving on to this week's effort, a film I actually would recommend when it comes to this point next week, when you probably still haven't watched it. We're going to be talking today about a film called Goodwill Hunting.

Rob: 06:35
Yep.

Kev: 06:35
Yep. So that is all you knew when you came in. Obviously, before the podcast, we just double check. Uh I send Rob uh a question about whether he's heard of the film or anything like that. He uh he's confirmed that he doesn't, and he's had a little bit of time to think about a couple of alternative or well, a couple of storylines that he thinks it might be based on that.

Rob: 06:55
Um I am looking forward to this because my mind has gone wild over the last couple of the last couple of days.

Kev: 06:60
Excellent. So with that said, let's move into our first main section, which is plot luck. Rob, take it away, talk us through it. What have you got for us for goodwill hunting?

Rob: 07:09
So obviously you mentioned last week I'm gonna do goodwill hunting, and I've heard of the film, but I've got absolutely no context around what it might be involving. So I've got two two examples of what the film might be about. And I'm gonna go through them and I'm gonna let you decide which well, I'm probably gonna decide because one of them is way more advanced of a thought than the other kid. But um I'll let you decide.

Kev: 07:29
Well, I might just choose the other one just despite you know.

Rob: 07:31
I will overheel you because I can't wait to tell you about the film I thought about. So the the first thought is that um it's about a young talented kid with a bad upbringing. He's called Will. Of course. Of course. Uh and he needs to prove Is he called Will Hunting? No, don't be daft. That's way too cheesy. Um He needs to up uh to prove that he has outstanding moral fibre uh to win a scholarship to an Ivy League school, but uncovers a mystery which impacts his past and his future.

Kev: 08:02
A mystery that impacts his past. That's interesting. To impact something from the past is an interesting concept.

Rob: 08:08
If you want to hear more, Kev, all you have to do is say and we can go through that one.

Kev: 08:11
Okay, alright. So that's your first thought. So he's some sort of gifted chap. Yep. He but he can't afford to go to a college.

Rob: 08:19
Have to choose that one to find out.

Kev: 08:21
Alright, okay. Go on, and what's what's option two?

Rob: 08:23
Uh uh obviously, while I was thinking of that, one of the things that popped into my head was that in America they call charity shops goodwill. Yes. So my second thought was that uh a recently released criminal is trying to go straight and doing so by hunting in goodwill shops. Oh, yeah, what he buys. It's a bit of retail arbitrage, I think that's what it's called. I'll take your word for it. Um and while he's doing that, he finds and buys something which drags him back into the criminal life and threatens his recovery.

Kev: 08:52
That is a much better I'll be honest, that's a much better sounding plot than the first one. That would draw me in a lot more, but I think you're more excited about the first. And I feel that the second idea has gotten no further than that. That's the first one I've got ideas for. I feel like it might crush you if I choose the second option, but I would like to explore that maybe at another time. So it sounds like we're going for the first option, something about an Ivy League school. Is that correct?

Rob: 09:17
Yep, it's dramatic, it's emotional. I nearly made myself cry coming up with it, which I mean, it must be good.

Kev: 09:24
I mean, it is really going to tug at the heartstrings, is it? Uh emotionally devastating, I'd say. Emotionally devastating. Somewhat like this podcast, I imagine, for anybody unfortunate enough to be listening. Okay, that is what we've chosen from plot luck then. Yep. Okay. It's time to uh to thicken this plot. Am I jumping straight in? Well, you said you've got lots more ideas. I mean, I could throw in some things here. Um, would you like to know where you've weirdly stumbled upon some pretty strong parallels with the real story? Absolutely. Um yes, I guess I do. All right. The main character is indeed called Will. In fact, he's called Will Hunting. Uh of course. I thought that would be too cheesy. You would think, wouldn't you? Well, I think he's called Will Hunting. I'm pretty sure he's called Will Hunting. He's an eponymous character, sure. Let's call him Will Hunting. Anyway, so yes, there is him. In the film, he is a genius. Okay. In the film, he ends up attending MIT, the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Rob: 10:25
I I mean, this could be the same film.

Kev: 10:28
It could be. I would also say that this film is an emotionally uh extremely involving movie. So one thing I will say is Are you sure you haven't seen it?

Rob: 10:37
Is my first question. I absolutely haven't. Uh he doesn't end up in MIT in my film. Okay.

Kev: 10:42
My uh could he? No. Okay, alright. Well we'll we'll not push that point later then, shall we? Okay, go on then. Yeah, tell me all about that. Last week we had great times working out who was going to be playing your main character. Have you got any thoughts about who is playing your guy, Will?

Rob: 10:60
Yeah, so Will's the protagonist. Of course. He's about 17, 17, 18, so he's just out of high school.

unknown: 11:07
Okay.

Kev: 11:08
Okay, yeah, hence trying to get into uh private leadership.

Rob: 11:11
Exactly. He's quiet, he's unassuming, but he's razor sharp. Okay. So he's smart as a button. He's likable but not popular. Right. He's played by Have You Watched Stranger Things? Uh no.

Kev: 11:26
He's played by someone from Stranger Things.

Rob: 11:28
He's played by someone I don't know the actor's name, but he's called Steve Harrington in Stranger Things. Okay, so for any listeners, if you can picture Steve Harrington from Stranger Things, that's Will now. He is a quintessential, high school, good looking lad, long hair, could be a quarterback, that sort of thing.

Kev: 11:45
Oh, okay. So he's a bit of a jock as well, is he?

Rob: 11:48
Mm-hmm I wouldn't say jock, I'd just say he's he's a good looking lad from high school and around.

Kev: 11:52
So he's not got the sports talent, but he it he looks like he should have.

Rob: 11:55
Absolutely. Okay, alright. And he is he's clever enough for an Ivy League school, but he doesn't have the resources.

Kev: 12:03
Yep. Costs a lot to go there in the States, I do believe. Yep.

Rob: 12:07
Um I I googled how much it costs. Oh, go away. I've prepared to go to an Ivy League school, and it's $30,000 a year.

Kev: 12:13
Is that all pathetic? Well, I thought.

Rob: 12:15
Well, Will can't scrape that together. Oh, he's an orphan. Oh, of course. Sorry, I didn't remember.

Kev: 12:19
Is he an orphan? He's an orphan, yeah. Well that's interesting because he's also an orphan in Goodwill Hunting. And I'm gonna ask again, are you certain you've not seen the film and just forgotten? I'm slightly worried this is seeked into my consciousness somehow because genuinely I haven't seen it. Oh well, okay, right. Well he's an orphan in the real film, so I mean, here we go. Go on, keep going then.

Rob: 12:38
So uh he is an orphan in my film, and we know uh that he's an orphan, but we don't know why. We know he's been brought up in foster care. There's some early scenes which shows that he actively avoids learning about what his parents had done to get him into foster care. But we know they're not great people.

Kev: 12:54
Alright, so he's not actively interested in his past.

Rob: 12:58
Absolutely not. Okay, alright. But based on knowing that his parents have been not necessarily angels in the past, he's very motivated to be good. He's a very good character, he's a very nice person, goodwill. Correct. And he he wants to outgrow their shadow and uh become his own person, and that's the basics of him as a character.

Kev: 13:23
Okay, so he he's too hard up, he can't get into this Ivy League school without a sponsorship or scholarship or whatever you got. Yeah, scholarship, that's what they're called.

Rob: 13:30
Uh a scholarship for showing outstanding moral fibre. That's what I was saying.

Kev: 13:34
Outstanding moral fibre, so nothing to do with intellect, simply for outstanding moral fibre.

Rob: 13:38
Because a lot of people have the intellect.

Kev: 13:40
Yeah.

Rob: 13:41
Some of them have the money, some of them don't. He doesn't, unfortunately. But to prove that he's worth a place, he's got to show outstanding moral fibre.

Kev: 13:47
Okay.

Rob: 13:47
And that's that's the start of the film. We've we've set it up. We know now the main part of the film, he'll be going to prove that he's got that moral fibre that he needs.

Kev: 13:55
And you're certain that he can't be trying to get into MIT just to make it even more of a parallel with the real film?

Rob: 14:00
Harvard at this point.

Kev: 14:01
Harvard. Same city, I do believe. Is it? I think they're both in Boston.

Rob: 14:06
Harvard's definitely in Boston.

Kev: 14:06
MIT's definitely in Boston.

Rob: 14:08
Well, I mean, we could have put MIT at this point, but I think Harvard's pretty arbitrary.

Kev: 14:11
Would you like to know that Harvard also features in the real goodwill hunting? I am worried. In a tangential early way.

Rob: 14:20
I'm surprised how close this is because I've genuinely not watched it. I'm starting to think that some of this has seeped into my consciousness.

Kev: 14:26
I am very firmly of the belief that that's happened. But let's keep going.

Rob: 14:31
Subconsciously, because I've genuinely never watched it and I've never. I may have seen the front cover. Is it like autumnal the front cover? It is.

Kev: 14:39
I think it's quite autumnal, yeah. That's that's the vibe. I think they're in a park on a bench. I don't know who's in it. Is Steve Harrington in it? Well, I don't know who Steve Harrington is, but given that is it Stranger Things is is or isn't about a bunch of teenagers, right? Yes, he's in high school. So none of them would have been alive when Goodwill Hunting was in. Well, it's it's of the same sort of era as Face Software, I would say. It's about 30 years old, weirdly now. Maybe 27, 28 years old, at a guess. I haven't done that much research. That's for next week when I give some feedback on it.

Rob: 15:13
This whole episode might have to be scrapped if I've if I've absolutely just listed the whole thing.

Kev: 15:17
Well, let's hope we haven't wasted everybody's time, especially my own. Brilliant. Non-taken. Okay, right. So he's trying to get into Harvard. Yeah. How's it go on then? Keep going.

Rob: 15:30
So he he's got the chance to get into Harvard, although my notes say Georgia Tech. I must have changed it from Georgia Tech to Harvard at some point. But don't worry about that. Okay. Um he he needs to prove that he's got exceptional moral fibre, and he's got a mentor at Harvard who suggested that he's a dead cert to get in.

Kev: 15:47
Okay. Uh this mentor works at Harvard.

Rob: 15:51
No, he's on the approval committee.

Kev: 15:53
On the approval committee.

Rob: 15:54
So the the group of people who would suggest whether he's the right person or not.

Kev: 15:59
Okay. So he's got an in with the panel.

Rob: 16:01
Yeah.

Kev: 16:01
And he's just a formality then, surely.

Rob: 16:04
Well, here you go. He the person on the commit committee, by the way, said he's a dead cert.

Kev: 16:08
Dead cert.

Rob: 16:09
Yeah. All he has to do is continue what he's doing.

Kev: 16:11
Just gotta turn up. Just gotta phone it in. He's there.

Rob: 16:13
Not phone it in, he's got to continue what he's doing, but if he does that, he's in.

Kev: 16:18
Okay. Well, I mean it's not sounding like a particularly interesting film at this point, so keep going.

Rob: 16:22
Oh, he doesn't get more interesting than that. So we then go into a little bit more of what he's done. I love a montage. Apparently so. So there is then going to be a montage similar to last week of him raising money raising money for local charities, no, uh, tutoring local kids, helping renovate a local park. Right.

Kev: 16:42
Basically showing that he's too he he's he's so good and he's moral fibre, he's up there with the best of the and then and you're sure you want to do that in montage form rather than something less 40 years old in in film nature. I think we can make it have you seen Rocky? No. Oh, for Christ's sake. Right. I I know so it's not a Rocky Star montage. You don't know what that means. This like this is unbelievable. Right. Okay, so it's a montage nonetheless. It is about boxing. You're right. Very good. Okay, so it's a montage of fundraising again. You realise that that lost you points in scoring at the end of last week when you went down that route.

Rob: 17:20
I'm putting my weight behind a charity fundraising montage.

Kev: 17:23
Okay, go on, carry on.

Rob: 17:25
The montage is done. And he's got a big plan for the summer. His final big plan for the summer. He's going to work at his local library where they need help organising the archives.

Kev: 17:37
Oh dear. I I mean, I don't want to jump into your story here. Feel free. Tell me where you think this is. Do I sense that he's going to find out an uncomfortable truth about his origin story from the archives? Do you want me to jump into it straight away? Well, I mean, we're about 20 minutes in, so yeah, best half.

Rob: 17:57
So there's there's two things to know about working in the archives at the library.

Kev: 18:01
One, uh, you might run into ghosts like in Ghostbusters. Don't be absorbed. Which you must have seen.

Rob: 18:06
No. Um I've seen the remake with three female actors. Does it start in a library? No idea. Okay. Um, firstly, he meets uh somebody else who's volunteering there, who's the librarian's daughter.

Kev: 18:19
Oh, love interest. Potentially. Should be played by Mini Driver if we're going to be faithful to the real film. I've not got a name for that.

Rob: 18:25
I've got a name for her, I've not got a character for her. Do you know what she's gonna be called?

Kev: 18:28
What's she gonna be called?

Rob: 18:28
Grace. Grace. So Will and Grace. Oh dear. Okay. I laughed at Will and Grace for a good five minutes when I was writing these notes. Amazing. She's very popular. So popular, in fact, she can't be trusted to spend the summer alone. So her mum, who's a librarian, has made her work in the library.

Kev: 18:48
Okay, so she's a bit of a kind of live wire character, is she? She is. A little bit more streetwise than what. She's not gonna lead Will down a dark path, surely.

Rob: 19:00
I I would imagine we will come to that.

Kev: 19:03
Alright, carry on.

Rob: 19:04
So there is gonna be a discovery while we're in the archives. As you've as you've alluded to already. It's probably a little bit obvious. So while searching the archives, sorry, while sorting the archives, they they obviously find something. And uh Will is perturbed to find that Grace has found something about his parents. Does she know she's discovered something about his parents, or is this just a So as part of the onboarding of getting into the archives, they they there's a little bit of tit for tat with them and they get to know each other a little bit. She knows a little bit about him. They talk about his parents but not too much. Right. But she notices straight away it's about his parents.

Kev: 19:43
So she is she's she's clued in on this, she knows it's a good thing. Oh does she try and keep it from him or does she sense a bit of an opportunity for mischief here? She loves it.

Rob: 19:52
She can't wait because for the first time in his life, Willie's gonna find out what's happened to his parents.

Kev: 19:59
Do you know what's happened to his parents?

Rob: 20:01
Yep, I'm gonna tell you. Oh, go on. They're in prison.

Kev: 20:04
No, not in prison.

Rob: 20:06
Both of them?

Kev: 20:07
Both of them.

Rob: 20:08
For it might get a little bit dark. For Arson.

Kev: 20:11
Arson? Yeah. Okay. Well, at least they didn't abuse him like uh um his foster parents did in the real film. Are they in prison as well? Uh well we don't actually find that out particularly. He's left them behind in his life by the real film, but go on.

Rob: 20:28
So in in this case, his foster parents are fine, it's his real parents. Got it. They're in prison for arson at a local community centre.

Kev: 20:35
Okay.

Rob: 20:36
Which may go some way to showing that why he's organically gone to saving some parks and stuff like that to show that he's got a good amount of fibre. He's naturally reverted by his parents have done it.

Kev: 20:47
Okay.

Rob: 20:50
But he's fixing it. So obviously they find out that that's happened. He's not very happy that she's found out what's happened. But they do dig a little bit deeper. And they do find some other information which potentially would prove his parents innocent.

Kev: 21:07
Oh, they're casting doubt over the entire conviction.

Rob: 21:11
And there's quite a big piece of her trying to convince him to dig a little deeper. He's kind of washed his hands of his parents a little bit. He he knows that they're bad eggs and doesn't want to go any further into it. But she convinces him and they actually find a piece of evidence which proves In the archives? Yeah, it's a newspaper clipping.

Kev: 21:31
A newspaper clipping has the proof in it.

Rob: 21:33
With a photo of somebody causing the arson. Can you cause arson? Doing the arson?

Kev: 21:38
Committing? Committing the arson. Committing the arson. So they have stumbled upon a newspaper which has a picture of somebody committing a crime of arson. In the background that nobody's ever noticed. No nobody ever done. The defence team didn't notice. No. Nope. Don't don't pick holes in this. The people covering it for the newspaper didn't notice. We've got that and we've got a picture of that in the archives. Yeah, yeah, let's run That with the main story.

Rob: 22:01
Big sort of the building that was built.

Kev: 22:05
Oh dear. Okay, right. So maybe they're innocent. Maybe they're innocent or they are innocent.

Rob: 22:09
Maybe m they're well, this this is proving that somebody else is doing it, but this is more about who out who is doing it and not who isn't doing it.

Kev: 22:15
Oh no, please tell me it's not his sponsor. No, of course not. That would be daft. Okay.

Rob: 22:20
It is a local property developer.

Kev: 22:22
Oh, these pesky local property developer.

Rob: 22:26
I know I've written this, but it is always a property developer. And he is currently sitting on the admissions committee at Harvard.

Kev: 22:35
Oh, along with his mentor.

Rob: 22:37
Along with his mentor. There's a few people on it.

Kev: 22:39
They should call this movie Face Art.

Rob: 22:43
So you can see where the conflict is starting to come in.

Kev: 22:46
I can see where where it's coming in. Is there a point in this film where he might try and solve some complex mathematical equations by writing on a mirror? Could we put that in? Is it is it maths that he's that he that he could be going for?

Rob: 23:01
It can be.

Kev: 23:02
Okay, in which case, let's put in the scene where he's going to solve a complex equation by writing on a mirror.

Rob: 23:07
So I I I think potentially this ties into the next bit. Because there's a moral dilemma coming up. You can probably tell what it is. And his moral dilemma is does he expose the truth? Potentially saving his parents from prison because they've clearly been stitched up by this property developer. Or does he just let it be? He knows his parents aren't angels. They probably deserve to be in prison anyway for all the things they've done. They have been framed, they didn't do this.

Kev: 23:33
This is just what they did. This is just what they went down for.

Rob: 23:35
This is the straw that broke the camel's back. So there could be a bit when they're in the library where Grace, who is like, Why don't you just sort this out? Why don't you just get this fixed? And she is trying to explain to him, and he's saying, No, this is why, and he he draws in numbers all the moral dilemmas he's going through to try and prove why it's not as easy as just getting it sorted.

Kev: 23:59
On the mirror, please, just to make sure it's a fine. On a mirror, sorry, I missed that. Just to make sure we're on brand the original film.

Rob: 24:05
All the time you can see Grace in the background looking at him like, why wouldn't you just sort this out?

Kev: 24:10
Yeah, and why wouldn't you just use a piece of paper?

Rob: 24:12
Don't worry about that. No paper sound. What he had was a mirror and a sharpie.

Kev: 24:18
And a sharpie. Yeah. Permanent. Perfect. Permanent. So there's no going back. There's no going back. There's no going back.

Rob: 24:25
And I feel like I've handled that curveball pretty well.

Kev: 24:28
Yeah, sure.

Rob: 24:28
Fine. We are coming to the endgame. No, we're progressing.

Kev: 24:32
Well, I don't know. I mean, I can see that that would take some time to develop within the movie.

Rob: 24:36
Lots of montages.

Kev: 24:37
No, there's no more montage. Right. There are no montages in this film. That is a red line. We don't need montage. We can have exposition through dialogue and discussion. We can discover things through his interactions with others without extended montages. This is my film.

Rob: 24:53
If I want montage after montage, they will be there. Okay. He's going through all this moral dilemma with Grace. He's fond of Grace, Grace is fond of him. And you can see they're starting to, even though he's he's a bit of a nerd and she's super popular, they're bonding over there, volunteering.

Kev: 25:12
Okay.

Rob: 25:13
But we're getting to the end game now. Right. And there is a curveball. And I call it the Grace Power move. It's got a name.

Kev: 25:22
The Grace Power move.

Rob: 25:23
He's got a name. And is it a twist? It is a twist. While he's in his own head, wondering whether he should sacrifice everything he's worked for. She's not going to take the decision for him, is she? Don't jump ahead, Kev. Sorry. You're so excited, I can tell.

Kev: 25:35
I'm very excited by the prospect of this film. He is.

Rob: 25:41
He's he spent all his high school life proving he's good enough, he's out of his parents' shadow, and he's got the option to expose someone on the committee, which would ruin his chances of going to Harvard, or keep him quiet. A real moral dilemma. Don't forget, he's trying to show outstanding moral fibre.

Kev: 26:00
So is this during the interview panel like hearing that this is coming to a head? Is there is there going to be a physical hearing where they're all in the same room and he's got to make that choice in that moment, or is this all happening via letters? This is because that's less interesting, but probably more in keeping with your montage.

Rob: 26:19
This is happening, and all the way through the film we see bits of his interview with the committee. We're calling back to little bits of things they're asking just as he's not done that thing and just as he's not said the thing he should have. So you can see he's he's harking back to the interview where he said one thing, but when it's push has come to shove, he's doing an the opposite thing.

Kev: 26:40
I see. Is the interview happening before these things? Is the interview the actual time frame of the film and all the other bits are flashes back? Or is the interview already happened? Is the interview and then he's not doing the things that he said after them already happened.

Rob: 26:56
It started at the beginning where he was like, Will you are great, you've got the grades, you just need to prove outstanding moral fibre. Do you think you could do that? Yes, I show this characteristic and this characteristic. And every time he breaks one of them promises, we see a snip back to that to say, Look, you do not practice what you preach.

Kev: 27:13
I see. Right. Okay, fine.

Rob: 27:16
And I I can tell you're loving it.

Kev: 27:17
Yep. I mean, I think that's there's stuff to be work with. I I think as directors, we would be very different in the way that we approach them. I would be very firmly a non-montage-based director, I think. You seem to want to do everything exclusively via the medium of the montage. I don't watch films, so my film history. Yeah, but you haven't seen Rocky, which is where montages are I mean the the ultimate montage is Rocky training. You must have seen the Rocky Montage, where he's punching a frozen ham and stuff like that. I've never seen it by the tiger. Did he run up a hill or steps? He runs up the Philadelphia steps, yes.

Rob: 27:55
I know of it, but I've never seen it.

Kev: 27:57
It's the definitive movie montage, I would say. But maybe others might have different opinions.

Rob: 28:02
Maybe maybe maybe I mean I've never watched Rocky all the way through, to be fair.

Kev: 28:06
Oh, it bores me. You're criticising me for not watching it in the Well no, it staggers me that you haven't seen it, given your fetish for montages, which I assumed that that was kind of ground zero for your for your I'll try and figure out where the the the montage things come from.

Rob: 28:21
But the plot twist is that while Will is in his own head, Grace publishes the story. She doesn't wait for Will to make up his mind. How does she publish it? Erm local press. Alright, she just breaks it, she didn't tell someone. Don't forget she's a librarian's daughter, so she's got some. She's got a contact. She's got contrast.

Kev: 28:41
Everybody knows the librarian's daughter has contact in the media.

Rob: 28:44
I assume she just puts on a blog or something like that. Yeah, probably just big local news. Goes viral somehow. But she's not bound by his moral dilemma that she's struggling with. And uh frankly, she's bored of powerful men being protected.

Kev: 28:58
Oh well, okay. So she's gonna. Well no, so is she is she hang on, is she showing some outstanding moral fibre here? Well, no, surely not. Not the daughter of the librarian.

Rob: 29:08
I think we'll get I think we'll come right around to that. I'll come full circle. So obviously the story gets out there. Justice is served, the parents getting out of prison is pretty much a side story. We don't really touch on that. We just know they've got our prison. The uh the that cheeky blinking developer, um the the building developer's now been sanctioned for what he did.

Kev: 29:29
He's disgraced, isn't he? Yeah, he's disgraced, he's absolutely so he was involved in whatever this thing was.

Rob: 29:35
He did it, he actually did it, he initiated it, uh he stitched them up, he he Because they were bad people the mastermind of the whole plot. Exactly. Because they were bad people anyway.

Kev: 29:45
It was easy to And he's been judging people on their outstanding moral fibre, they're cheeky, but they're hypocrisy.

Rob: 29:50
The problem is with things like this, money talks, and he is a local property developer, and we know they've got money and no morals.

Kev: 29:56
Well, yeah. Um for any local property developers out there uh who feel besmirched, maybe just get a different career.

Rob: 30:03
Thank you, exactly. I didn't expect that to end that way, but I agree. What we see at the end is he gets accepted to Harvard. Anyway, yeah.

Kev: 30:11
Oh, yeah, because he didn't actually have to do it. He didn't do anything because he didn't actually have to do anything. I thought you said there was gonna be an emotional tear jerk, he's just got into Harvard. Just wait.

Rob: 30:19
Okay, right because he's won the battle. But not the war. But he's not won the war. Because he hasn't shown the integrity which is mentioned in his Harvard acceptance letter. And he hasn't shown the moral leadership that he promised to in his interview, and he hasn't shown the courage of character which he's been preaching.

Kev: 30:37
Right. But he still gets into Harvard. But Grace has. Uh yeah, I told him, yeah.

Rob: 30:43
He he's he's show he's shown them enough to get into Harvard, and they what they see outwardly, he's helped his community, he's helped at the library, he's done all the things he promised to do, he's got in.

Kev: 30:53
Which to be fair is is quite a lot to expect of a 17 or 18-year-old.

Rob: 30:57
I don't think they were uh desperately looking for Did I not say he was very driven to prove that he get out of his parents' shadow?

Kev: 31:04
Very driven.

Rob: 31:05
And actually the the acceptance layer just it kills him because he's reading all these things and he realizes how he's failed. He's failed. And the last scene the set the last scene with Grace is they've they've drifted apart. There's no there's no explosion from Grace. She's just opted out. She's just disappointed with him.

Kev: 31:29
So he hasn't pushed her away like in the real film. I don't know why in the real film, but no. He sort he sort of pushes her away by his his lack of ability to attach emotionally to.

Rob: 31:40
No, it's it's not a conscious thing from him. He wants to stay with Grace. He he's fallen for Grace at this point.

Kev: 31:47
She's got into Harvard now.

Rob: 31:48
She doesn't go she doesn't get into Harvard, she doesn't go mad, she she doesn't shame him, she just walks away. And the last thing she says to him is, You'll be great at that place. And it kills him, Kev.

Kev: 31:60
Oh, because that's like a a backhanded swipe, is it? Uh you you and the rest of them, those Harvard and it's un it unravels him.

Rob: 32:08
And the very last film scene is he's at Harvard and he's meeting some new people who've also got scholarships, and they say to him, How did you get in? And he says, I tried to be good.

Kev: 32:21
I tried to be good. I've got a tear in my eye. Oh, I'm glad somebody has that. I tried to be good. Well, there we there we have it. I mean, it you certainly had written most of that. I I I've thoroughly enjoyed that one. Obviously, extremely motivated by just by the title across the last course of the last week.

Rob: 32:40
If the real film is better than that, I will eat my heart.

Kev: 32:42
I mean, the real film, based on what you think, like how you think that film would be great, I actually would strongly recommend you watch the real film of Goodwill Hunting.

Rob: 32:51
Is it quite close?

Kev: 32:52
Um there's lots of overlap. I don't want to sort of ruin it for you. I should I should probably try and get you to just shoehorn in a couple of bits, as that's the sort of the main premise of this. So um but I think it's it wasn't. I mean, I didn't want you were on a roll, weren't you? So we've put the we've we've put in writing stuff on a mirror. That was relatively easy. I feel like you're not going to be able to make him commit a violent assault on a childhood bully. No. Uh because that's that's not gonna go down well with the committee.

Rob: 33:18
But there's probably a a place where he should do, and he doesn't, and that proves that he's he's a good person towards the start of the montage.

Kev: 33:25
Yeah. I mean that we've we've talked that there's a love interest that ultimately doesn't seem to pan out, although that that question is left hanging in the air. For goodwill hunting, too.

Rob: 33:36
Or Grace Hunting.

Kev: 33:40
Grace hunting. That would work. Well, yeah, but only if they get married. Well, that's the point. Did I tell you Matt Damon's in the real one? No. Okay. Um he could be the tutor, he could be the mentor. He could be when this film was made, Matt Damon was probably, I guess, maybe early 20s. So about the same age as T War Insert. In the film, I don't really want to tell you too much. I'm not I'm not going to watch it. You should watch it. I'm going to make sure that at least you could watch it. Don't feel that don't feel anybody should it. Uh, and I think currently in the UK you find it streaming on Netflix, because that's where I found it. Not a sponsor. Not a sponsor. We don't have sponsors. Um but yeah, I think that's currently where I found it. Matt Damon actually wrote the film or co-wrote the film with Ben Affleck, if you can picture him. He was from Friends. He's in Friends at the Disney. I don't know about that. I'm not sure. Did he go out with Jennifer Aniston? He I think they were married. I have confused real life. Maybe they might have been married.

Rob: 34:48
I it's for some reason in my head he's related to Jennifer Aniston.

Kev: 34:51
Or was no, hang on. Wasn't Ben Affleck married to Jennifer Lopez? Yes, he was. That's he was. Alright. We've taken a few uh I know of Ben Affleck. Okay, yeah. He was married to Jennifer Lopez, I think.

Rob: 35:05
I genuinely don't think I can name uh Ben Affleck or Matt Damon film. Is one of them in Mission Boss?

Kev: 35:10
Well you could name a film at the end Oh yeah, Marvel Good Lord, obviously. Um I'm fairly sure at least Matt Damon was in Oceans 11. I have seen that. And I feel like maybe Ben Affleck might have been. I think they might I might be wrong about that.

unknown: 35:25
Okay.

Kev: 35:26
It also had Robin Williams in it, and you must know who Robin Williams is.

Rob: 35:30
He was in Flubber.

Kev: 35:32
Of all of all the films I expected you to reference Mrs. Doubtfire. Flubber was there, right. This is Doubtfire, yeah. Flubber was not high on my on my list of guesses. I haven't seen Flubber. Um maybe next week we flip this if you can do it. I'll do Flubber. Um I think in that he invents some magic, like scientific compound that bounces around a lot or something like that. That's pretty much it. Which has got less of Flubber, but I mean I'm not in a hurry to watch it based on the premise of what I believe it to be. Um anyway, Robin Williams in this is is excellent, uh, and actually I'm fairly sure was an Oscar-winning performance for this movie, um, Robin Williams, and the screenplay writing was an Oscar winner as well. Um, and I think uh Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote it whilst studying together.

Rob: 36:28
I I reckon Matt Damon could if he's about 17, 18, could be the lead of this film.

Kev: 36:33
Well, I think um basically um there is a lot of similarities because I don't want to ruin too much, but basically he's a genius in Goodwill hunting, uh, who is who's had a very difficult upbringing, hates basically the world and everything about it, um, and is determined to waste the incredible uh intelligence that he has been born with. And Robin Williams, as a psychiatrist, tries to draw out of him um, you know, all that anger and anguish. That sounds nothing like my film. It sounds exactly like your film.

Rob: 37:04
A young, talented kid, and that's it.

Kev: 37:07
A young talented kid in Harvard. Well, I mean, in the actual Goodwill Hunting film, they go to a Harvard bar.

Rob: 37:16
I forgot about the Harvard Bar.

Kev: 37:18
Um gloved there, but where where he embarrasses a Harvard undergrad for basically regurgitating and recycling and passing you know ideas off as his own and trying to impress girls and stuff.

Rob: 37:28
I feel though that Matt Damon's character and Steve Harrington's character, both equally good actors, would would have uh opposing views on life though.

Kev: 37:37
Yeah, but I mean they might do. I mean, there is a brilliant bit in the film, and I won't give you the context for why he says it. And again, this is gonna be an impression that has absolutely nothing to do with my fundamental lack of copyright law knowledge. Um we just uh we don't want to risk putting in a in a clip. So instead you get this pretty terrible impression. But uh yeah, Will at one point says, While I'm at it, why don't I just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to a sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe, and join the National Guard. I can be elected president. I mean, can you see how that's going into yours? Where is that come from? Um well that's good will hunting.

Rob: 38:17
Right. I was so encaptivated with the performance, I didn't listen to half of it.

Kev: 38:21
Clubbing a seal. Club of baby seal, yeah, that's right. Um so yeah, while I'm at it, why not just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to a sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe, and join the National Guard. I can I can be elected president.

Rob: 38:35
I can tie this into my film, no problem.

Kev: 38:38
Big time you can.

Rob: 38:38
Because when Grace is trying to convince him to just do the right thing, he's saying, why not do all these things which go against all my moral code? Exactly so. This is brilliant for me.

Kev: 38:49
Yeah, I mean I think it works. I think it works. I think we've pretty much flashed it out. I don't think we've actually lost the plot in this episode. I think we've actually formed one.

Rob: 38:56
I'm gonna find out how to submit this as a film and get somebody to write it. I'm gonna ring I'm gonna ring, I was gonna say, I'm gonna DM Matt Damon DM. I was gonna ring him and DMMD. Interesting. Exactly, yeah.

Kev: 39:09
Um so would you I mean there's there's one more bit one more quote I particularly love from Goodwill Hunting. That's when Robin Williams' character says, It's not about you, you mathematical dick. So uh could he could he call someone a mathematical dick?

Rob: 39:25
That is Grace's immediate response to him writing on the mirror. Aha. When he tries to convert a moral dilemma into a mathematical equation or a scientific thing. Yeah, yeah.

Kev: 39:35
And not everything can be reduced to numbers and coefficients. For goodness sake.

Rob: 39:40
You have to go with your heart.

Kev: 39:42
Follow your heart. Uh although it might not get you into Harvard, or it might get you into Harvard, but at what cost? He lost the wall. What cost, eh? And there we have it. I think a very reputable attempt at a movie there, so I suppose at times it's going to easily attempt to score this madness. Forgot what we're gonna score. Well, we've always got to score it, and I think what were the three? Coherence. I mean, I'm I'm not sure. Forget about the montage. But the montage comes into it later when it comes to entertainment factor, really. Coherence, I think I'm a bit confused about Grace's part and character character development. And she started off being this sort of troublesome imp character, and then by the end, she was the one showing the moral fire. It was a bit of a curveball.

Rob: 40:27
Yeah, she probably doesn't need to be morally bankrupt at the start of the film.

Kev: 40:31
Yeah, well, for consistency's and coherence's sake, I would recommend she possibly isn't, unless the only reason she does it is because she knows what chaos will ensue. But then it doesn't really make much sense that at the end she leaves him with that parting thing that put a tear in your eye. And I think that was arguably what you felt was the real strong point of the film.

Rob: 40:51
Can I counter that?

Kev: 40:52
You can try. I feel like But my main is made up.

Rob: 40:55
I wanted to bring in a bit of streetwise activity or streetwise knowledge to Will, and I think Grace provides that. She's lived a life, so she knows what's what. And actually, I think the start of their relationship, he thinks he can teach her something. Right. But the reality is she teaches him.

Kev: 41:11
There you go. So yes, I can see that that character arc makes some small agreement. And Will and Grace. And Will and Grace, which minus points for that. Um coherence, therefore. It's a pretty coherent story, to be honest. I'm not sure scholarships for moral fibre exist. Um certainly not at Harvard, where it's all just about academia. Um, but I suppose you already said he's got all the academia points ticked off, so why not? You've got to judge it on something. Worthiness seems as as reasonable factor as any, although they I suspect they probably do that basically on income rather than what's going on. What's wrong with the world? Come on, Harvard. Get your stuff together here, people. Okay, I but I do think it's quite coherent, and because there are so many parallels with the real goodwill hunting, I'm gonna give this coherence an eight.

Rob: 42:04
I'll take it.

Kev: 42:05
You should take it, and you should and you should thank me for it. Um so we're going with eight for coherence. Um, what's the next one? Um originality or entertainment factor. I can't remember what order we do it in. Let's go with originality. Alphabetical. Alphabetical. Uh Entertainment. All right, we'll go with entertainment factor. How I mean, how much do you really want to keep that montage? That sponsorship montage in there.

Rob: 42:35
I I think to set the scene of the things he's doing to prove his monofibre, we need I don't want to make a big deal of it.

Kev: 42:41
You've made it a flashback movie. You can show it through the flashbacks. It doesn't have to be a montage.

Rob: 42:46
It could be a flashback montage.

Kev: 42:50
I mean, aren't all montages are they all really flashbacks?

Rob: 42:54
All montages are flashbacks, but not all flashbacks are montages. I've just made them up. That might be the total run with the money.

Kev: 42:59
If that were true, then I would recommend you go for one of the flashbacks that isn't a montage. Either way, here we are, stuck in it. Um so we've got our flashbackslash montage system going on. I can see that there would be a lot of interesting character development stuff in the in the dusty archives of the local library. Do we ever see the librarian mother very much?

Rob: 43:25
No.

Kev: 43:25
No. Never once. Not even once. No.

Rob: 43:27
She's just a kind of once and that's it.

Kev: 43:30
Okay, that's that's possibly for the best. Okay. Um I mean, I can see that this would be entertaining. I I like what you've tried to do with the tear jugger ending. That's probably the strongest part of it, even though it doesn't actually really make masses of sense. I but but I think done the right way by the right director, which is absolutely wouldn't be you, um, I can see that it would be quite entertaining. I would give it a very solid seven. I think there'd be overly sentimental schmolts, so that's why it's not higher.

Rob: 43:58
I am smashing this.

Kev: 43:59
Yeah. This is much better than face off with John Candy. Already at fifteen. You are already at fifteen, already at fifty percent. This is great. This is great for me. Well, now it though comes to originality. No comment. I mean originality. What we haven't got many of the c the classic movie tropes in this one, I wouldn't say. I mean, you've got your complicated character with a a devastating past.

Rob: 44:26
I I'd say parents being incarcerated incorrectly. Incorrectly. I'd say there's something around that which is not too original.

Kev: 44:34
Yeah, and I would also say that was part of the story that I like the least, to be honest. I'm not sure why they had to be there, really. But I mean that's not really. I think you've lost for originality on that because it was an unnecessary trope that actually didn't really add anything to the story. I suppose they had to reveal something, but did it have to be that? I'm not sure. Not sure it had to be that.

Rob: 44:56
Potentially not, but did I do you remember the property developer?

Kev: 44:60
I do I do remember the property developer, the local that pesky local property developer who's very original, also. Or at least would have been before the advent of Scooby-Doo. So I'm only gonna give- You have seen Scooby-Doo. Yeah, I've seen I haven't seen the film. I'm talking about the cartoons. I've seen both. Yeah, get that sheet on and it'll be you'll look just like a ghost. Um scare them all away. Wouldn't even have to burn it down. They didn't burn it down. No, well, no, but the local property developer did get somebody to burn it down. He went too far with his plot. He shouldn't have had to go that far, really. He should have just put the sheet on. Five for originality.

Rob: 45:41
I think I'll take that.

Kev: 45:42
Yep, so you've got 20 out of 30, a solid 66.6 recurring percent.

Rob: 45:46
I am on on this trajectory, I am going to be a director in like three weeks.

Kev: 45:51
Yes, and we will all shut up when we see the trailer coming out. Okay, well, but very good effort. I actually thought that wasn't too bad. I'm staggered by the number of parallels. I know you don't think there's many parallels, but if you actually do bother to watch the film, I think you will find them.

Rob: 46:06
Do you know what? I I might go and watch it.

Kev: 46:08
I do strongly recommend you watch it. I think your good lady wife might enjoy it, possibly. Um, it's an emotional roller coaster of a film. Try not to spoil it for her by telling her all the things you would have done differently if you do sit down and watch it.

Rob: 46:19
That's one of the reasons we don't watch films.

Kev: 46:22
Um so thank you very much. We we are done with Goodwill Hunting, but I believe now is the time of the podcast where you attempt to demonstrate what I don't know about things which are assumed to be pop culture.

Rob: 46:37
Yeah, and I did mention Stranger Things, Steve Harrington, and it I've got to be able to do that. I'm glad to hear that you don't know about Stranger Things, so I do not. Similar to last time, I've got some questions about Stranger Well, I've got some questions about something that's popular that you probably don't.

Kev: 46:52
I'm going to just pause this for a minute and point out how utterly unequivalent these quizzes are to my basic premise of have you ever heard of face-off versus here's an oddly specific question about an exact episode about Doctor Who. But anyway, that was last week. So go on. I hope they're more basic than last week's.

Rob: 47:14
They are more basic. They are, I mean, they are pop culture.

Kev: 47:18
Well, it's pop culture, people. Come on. And how would I not know this?

Rob: 47:21
If you don't get three out of the four questions. We got four this time. Yeah.

Kev: 47:25
Oh, there we I look, I engineered a score that would give us a sort of 66.6% thing so we could tie, and you've taken it away by making yours out of four now.

Rob: 47:36
There was only three, but I'm gonna make up a four, so you can't sign with me. Uh but they're I think they're very basic questions. And it I I think I only started watching Netflix like two weeks ago. Not Netflix, Stranger Things on Netflix.

Kev: 47:49
So have you now watched the whole lot? No. Oh, okay, right, perfect.

Rob: 47:52
But I know these things, and I knew these things before I started watching.

Kev: 47:55
Well, alright, here we go.

Rob: 47:57
So, question one.

Kev: 47:58
Yes.

Rob: 47:58
And I've got multiple choice, but you might know. A bit like the TARDIS last week, you might know.

Kev: 48:02
Yeah, TARDIS was straightforward.

Rob: 48:04
What is the name of the alternate dimension in Stranger Things?

Kev: 48:08
Wait, hang on now, hang on now. I know of two names that come from three things that come from Stranger Things. One of them is Vecna, but I think maybe that's a baddie. One of them is something about Hellfire. Um do you want me to give you four options? Yeah, better had.

Rob: 48:23
Is it the upside down? Is it the shadow realm? Or is it the nether?

Kev: 48:29
Right. The nether is Minecraft. Yes, it is. What were the other ones?

Rob: 48:34
Uh the shadow realm, which might be a reference to something I don't know. Or the upside down.

Kev: 48:40
And you just tried to throw me off the case by saying, Oh, it might be a reference to something I don't know. I think that's the real one. No, it wasn't genuine. Oh no.

Rob: 48:53
It's the upside down. Oh dear. Okay. And I think that's pretty popular. Okay. Um this one's got a this one's pretty easy. Okay. So what number is tattooed on L's wrist?

Kev: 49:08
L? That's like a seven upside down, so I'll go with seven.

Rob: 49:11
You've you've cottoned onto L, but I'll give you I'll give you the I'll give you the opposite.

Kev: 49:15
It's not a seven then.

Rob: 49:17
One, seven, or eleven.

Kev: 49:19
One, seven, then it's not a seven. Or I've or it might be. Or I'm double the same. Okay, right. L could also look like an uh like a one arms like that, I suppose. Eleven, I'm struggling to see where L would come from. Eleven. Hello. I'll go with eleven. And you are right! Goodness me. Amateur sleuth hour.

Rob: 49:39
Her name's actually 11, but they call her Ellen.

Kev: 49:41
L Evan.

Rob: 49:42
Yeah. Um, and then can you name this is the third question. This was gonna be the final one, but if you get this right and we're tie, I might give you a tiebreaker. Okay, all right. So can you name one of the four lead male characters from season one?

Kev: 49:56
Um, I would say probably not, but I know there's a character called Eddie at some point, so I'm going with Eddie. And you're wrong. Uh I've come across another.

Rob: 50:05
Son of a gun. And I thought you might say Steve Harrington. Oh, why didn't I say Steve Harrington? He's not one of the main four. Oh, yeah, because he looks like a jock and they're all DD uh people. So it's Mike, Dustin, Lucas, and Will.

Kev: 50:16
Yeah, that's what I said.

Rob: 50:18
So I mean, they are pretty straightforward. Like if you look at Merch, if you've seen Merch.

Kev: 50:23
What Stranger Things I think they are.

Rob: 50:26
What how else are you put the upside down was on all the advertising boards.

Kev: 50:30
But the so right, the equivalent of not knowing what faceoff is is not knowing what Stranger Things is. I think it's not tracking. I think I've demonstrated I know what Stranger Things is. I don't know much about it, but I know it exists. I know the basic premise. They're a bunch of kids. Uh they come up, it's it's in the 80s, so there's all this 80s music and stuff and references. They like D D. You know, they're slightly uh kind of geeky characters, and we're supposed to kind of empathize, sympathize, but also find them a little bit kooky and a little bit weird.

Rob: 50:58
So Okay, I get your point. I get your point.

Kev: 51:02
But that's so that's surface level knowledge versus I think FaceOff's got John Candy in it. You got it basically doing call runnings.

Rob: 51:10
33%, and I got 66%, which proves me right. Uh do you want me to get a mirror out and write on the mirror?

Kev: 51:16
Well, if you if you wrote some equations on a mirror, it might help.

Rob: 51:20
I think yet again I've proved that your lack of popular culture is worse than mine.

Kev: 51:24
I disagree once again. Uh, but hey, listeners might have a different view. And of course, if you have got a view on it, feel free to somehow contact us. Not sure how.

Rob: 51:34
Write a letter. It's a letter. DM Matt Damon. Yeah.

Kev: 51:38
Yeah, that would be good to get in contact with Matt Damon and he will he will do his usual PA role for us.

Rob: 51:45
Do I do I get to know what film we're doing next week?

Kev: 51:48
Oh, that's a good thought, actually. Yeah, no, I haven't uh particularly thought I tell you what, one thing I will share with the listeners at this point is that um in preparation for this, I did send Rob a list of films to see what he would and wouldn't know about. Uh, because obviously if he if he's seen a film, it's not very useful to do it in this format. One of those films I asked him about was Forest Gump. Have you have you got that chat available that you could open, uh Rob? Do you want me to fill a bit of uh of dead space while you look for it? Can you find what your exact reaction to Forest Gump was? Because I found it extremely amusing what you thought.

Rob: 52:24
Oh, I can't find it.

Kev: 52:25
Okay, shall I tell you what it was? So when asked about Forest Gump, you said words to the effect of I know he runs somewhere, but I don't know why. Do you remember that? Yes. No, I love that for two reasons. One, because it's preposterous that anybody your age should that's all you know about Forrest Gump. But two, he does run a very long way, and he doesn't know why. So you are basically Forrest Gump. So that's that's anyway. We're not gonna do Forest Gump. Um, what shall we do for next week? I think it would be a good opportunity to explore a film called Reservoir Dogs. Any No, I've heard of it.

Rob: 53:14
Total blank expression. I don't know anything about it.

Kev: 53:16
Perfect. Well, you've got about a week to come up with some some potential plots for reservoir dogs. And if you get anywhere close, you'll have done well.

Rob: 53:25
Looking forward to it.

Kev: 53:26
Alright, well, until next time, that's that's it from us then for uh uh at the No Context Cinema Club. Hope you enjoyed the the episode. Um, if you haven't heard Face Off Yet, go and check that out. And otherwise, we'll see you next week when we look at reservoir dogs.

Rob: 53:39
Catch you later.
