Kev: 00:00
Hello and welcome back to the No Context Cinema Club, the show where we reimagine what the history of film could have been in the complete absence of cultural awareness or creative talent. Each week Rob rewrites a universally known film, armed only with a title and the potentially misleading snippets of information I choose to give him about the real movie along the way. Will Rob's almost unbelievable lack of movie awareness hold him back or reveal him to be an auteur? Only time will tell. So sit back with your popcorn and prepare to pelt it at the imaginary screen in front of you, as we present for its cinematic debut Rob's Cut of Minority Report. Good evening, Rob. How are you today?

Rob: 00:36
Hi, Kev. I'm good, thank you. How are you?

Kev: 00:38
I am all right. Have you watched Reservoir Dogs from last week?

Rob: 00:41
No.

Kev: 00:42
What a surprise. Is there even any point in me asking each week?

Rob: 00:45
No. I will if there's an exception, I will tell you.

Kev: 00:47
Excellent. All right. So if you are listening and want to hear any thoughts or a sort of summary of Reservoir Dogs, hang around to the very end of the podcast after the closing credits that don't exist, and we'll have a little run through of that. Right, before we move on, we've had our first email correspondence, Rob. Oh, that's exciting. It's from someone called Tom from Chippenham. Hello, Tom. Would you like to know what Tom from Chippenham has to say? Probably not, no. No, I think you probably do. It's me that doesn't, but here we go. Oh, excellent. Yeah. Right. So Tom from Chippenham has the following to say. I'm going to do it in a the voice I assume he has. Um Ned actually dies after being attacked by a Dilophosaurus. It's the lawyer that gets eaten on the toilet. So he's obviously just watched the first episode face off when you were talking about John Candy, or so you thought. Because I thought he was eaten on the toilet if you remember the guy in the yellow jacket.

Rob: 01:37
Oh. Yes.

Kev: 01:38
Tom from Chippenham tells me, nope.

Kev: 01:40
Ned actually dies after being attacked by a Dilophosaurus. It's the lawyer that gets eaten on the toilet. You're gonna do a voice every time.

Kev: 01:46
Well, if he ever emails in again, yeah, probably.

Rob: 01:50
Thanks for the correction. So just to clarify, I I think I mentioned in the show that John Candy didn't get eaten on the toilet.

Kev: 01:57
Well, you'd have to go and rewind and listen to it again to find that out. I was right. Well, it depends on whether you said that or not.

Rob: 02:03
Was it I think I was. Well, this is a good idea. Maybe you can find out, wouldn't you? Anyway, so often.

Kev: 02:11
He then goes on to say. Oh.

Kev: 02:13
No again. Oh, great. Yeah, here we go. Um the Doctor Who questions were easy. I I found gifts of each one in like five seconds. Oh, even better. So he's backing up that my quiz was nice and easy for us.

Kev: 02:24
Yes, but I mean, let's be fair, there's gifts of everything, aren't there? So just having a gif doesn't make anything, you know, that doesn't mean it's cultural zeitgeist.

Rob: 02:31
Where was Tom from again? Uh chipping on. So I'm if I'm ever in Chippin', Tom, I'm gonna come and buy you a beer. Because that's the news because Kev looks fuming.

Kev: 02:39
I'm not fuming, I'm just disappointed in the world. Yes. Of all the things to have the first email about it's this. Correcting you twice. Not correcting. Well, the first one's correcting. The second one was just an opinion. And Frank, as they say, opinions are like assholes. Everybody's got one. And everyone like Tom from Chippenham is one. Right. Um I was gonna chip in with them. Tom's is great. Probably one for the lawyers. Uh right. Tom appears to have some unresolved anger issues, but if anyone else wants to get in touch, uh don't forget you can reach us on either Kev or Rob at nocontextcinemaclub.com.

Rob: 03:15
Are you gonna be quite as nice to every email correspondent?

Kev: 03:18
It depends on whether they're like that or not, doesn't it? I love Tom. I bet you do. Right, on we go. So let's get straight into Minority Report this week's film uh and our first section, plot luck. Rob, what have you got for us?

Rob: 03:33
Uh so I was hamstrung because actually I did know that Tom Cruise was in the film.

Kev: 03:37
Oh yes, of course. So last week you told us you thought it was a plane and Tom Cruise.

Rob: 03:41
Yeah, and you kind of scoffed at the plane, so I've taken the plane out of it.

Kev: 03:45
Well, I hadn't re-watched it at that point. There might be a plane.

Rob: 03:47
Right, well, there's no plane in either of these. Okay, well there might be later, who knows? And uh but I know Tom Cruise was in it, so I had to kind of make sure there was a male lead for both of them. Okay.

Kev: 03:56
So here's maybe want to keep Tom Cruise in it for your for these parts. I mean you can take him out if you like. He's Tom Cruise attached to him.

Rob: 04:03
He's the main character in both of these. Ooh, okay. So uh here's the two options. First one, a once overlooked singer accidentally becomes the face of a viral minority report music review. Only for online conspiracy theorists to uncover their success is built on lies that leave the singer morally imprisoned. Morally imprisoned.

Kev: 04:23
Goodness me, that sounds intriguing. Okay. Great. Option two.

Rob: 04:28
Option two, a charismatic substitute teacher at an elite British school uncovers a data-driven minority report that quietly writes off students.

Kev: 04:37
Quietly writes off students.

Rob: 04:39
When he tries to beat the system from within, the system bites back and wins.

Kev: 04:44
Spoiler alert there.

Rob: 04:49
For those that haven't already watched it, that is a spoiler apologies for that.

Kev: 04:52
So that haven't already watched the film you're about to make up. The minority of people who haven't seen Rob's made-up film that hasn't even been written yet. Lead singer of a band who finds unexpected stardom and then something bad happens. Yep. Or substitute teacher, or as we would say in Britain, a supply teacher.

Rob: 05:11
Okay.

Kev: 05:12
I'd I wouldn't have known there's a difference. Of course not. Um so uh substitute teacher ends up trying to fight against a system and ultimately being destroyed by it. Yes. Spoiler. Um let's go well we've we've done with Goodwill Hunting, we sort of touched on a weird education-y, academic-y sort of setting one. So let's let's go with your musician. Excellent. Okay, so that's gonna that's plot luck. I mean, there's not much in that, I don't think, that's gonna fit with the actual minority port.

Rob: 05:42
I forget every week that you're gonna add a curveball into this.

Kev: 05:44
That is literally the premise of the show.

Rob: 05:47
I forget every week. I get so enthralled in writing these made-up films that I forget that you're gonna change it.

Kev: 05:54
What we should point out um at this point is that Rob fleshes out both of his options in advance in a way that I did not appreciate until last week when he showed me his copious He calls them notes. I would Ramblings. I would call them the insane ramblings of a lunatic. Um But either way, he does he you know, believe it or not, he does prepare for this. Don't let all the secrets out. That's hard. It's hard to believe, I know. Um right, let's crack on then. So we're going with this music one. Um so let's move into the plot thickens and get you to first of all, just tell me a little bit more. Not too much. So Tom Cruise throw something in there.

Rob: 06:29
Tom Cruise is the main character.

Kev: 06:31
Okay, yeah, he is in the main one, so that's fine. He's got a name. He's got a name, okay. He's uh called Mr. Nick Songs.

Rob: 06:40
Mr.

Kev: 06:41
Nick Songs. Yep. I sense I have a feeling that there's an element of nominative determinism involved in this film.

Rob: 06:50
I enjoyed coming up with that so much.

Kev: 06:52
Is this a comedy film?

Rob: 06:54
Uh no.

Kev: 06:55
It just makes me laugh. Okay. Do we have to call him Nick Songs?

Rob: 07:01
Because purely for the fact he's gonna make me laugh every time I mention it, yes.

Kev: 07:05
Nick Songs, Nick Songs it is, played by Tom Cruise, of course. Tom Cruise. Right. I might call him Nick or Tom into chat. So, how does he find this unexpected musical success? And what has it got to do with a minority report?

Rob: 07:16
So the film opens, and um it's Nick, he's the lead singer of a band called Footnote.

Kev: 07:23
That's not a bad name for a band, actually. Thank you.

Rob: 07:25
Yeah. That's the end. That's all that's the only good things about it. That's the only praise you're getting away. Yeah, you didn't get praise for next songs. Um he's the lead singer of the band, uh they're supporting an artist, and at the same time, this is the opening scenes, we cut to a bustling magazine preparing for their biggest edition of the year. A music magazine. A music magazine, yeah. I don't know that I don't know any music magazine. Uh Q, Enemy? Yeah, one of them. Q, is that not a garden?

Kev: 07:54
Uh that's Q K-E-W.

Rob: 07:56
A lot of all the different letters coming up. Q or MMA.

Kev: 08:01
I think I think Q magazine still exists, it must do. I don't know if magazines in general exists. Well, that's true. I mean they're all online, aren't they? Easy, as if that's a thing. Easine, yes, isn't it? Yeah, and if you are a local property developer or a waitress, or a writer for an easy, just get a new job.

Rob: 08:19
So the the magazine are about to release what they call the minority report.

Kev: 08:23
Okay, what is the the minority report from the magazine then?

Rob: 08:27
It's an annual review that we get in every year, and it reviews the bottom ten attended gigs that they went to in the last 12 months.

Kev: 08:35
Right, so all of their music journos make a list of the gigs they've been to where there was nobody there. The least attended gigs.

Kev: 08:43
The lowest attended, hence minority. Wow, that is stretching. Okay.

Rob: 08:50
You're on board so far, yeah. And uh what they do, they review the the bottom ten attended gigs and they try and flip it on there, they're trying to do a good thing. Oh right.

Kev: 08:58
And then they're trying to give some some coverage to some unlikely heroes. So like Nick Songs. Or Footnote.

Rob: 09:05
Nick Songs, yeah. The the main buzz in the office is about Footnote. Even though they're supporting a failing artist, they've identified Footnote and specifically Nick Songs as a highlight of the year.

Kev: 09:15
Because he's a charismatic frontman, is he?

Rob: 09:17
Bit miserable, actually. Oh, okay. He's just very good.

Kev: 09:22
He's just very talented singing some good songs. Making up for the complete lack of charisma of a frontman. Alright. Let's let's suspend our disbelief and carry on.

Rob: 09:32
Maybe there is charisma when he's on stage, it's just a lot of people.

Kev: 09:36
Does he use uh some sort of illicit drug?

Rob: 09:39
Uh does whiskey count?

Kev: 09:41
Um sure.

Rob: 09:42
It's not particularly illicit.

Kev: 09:44
I can tie that in and prohibition era America.

Rob: 09:47
No, no, this is current. This is current, it has to be current because social media gets involved. Oh, okay. Alright. So uh the we see the magazine buzzing around, uh footnote and and Nick Songs himself. And we we cut back to Nick leaving the gig. There's no fanfare, he's just walking home back to his quiet, empty flat. He's clearly struggling. Right.

Kev: 10:09
Financially. How do we know he's clearly struggling to go?

Rob: 10:11
Because he's going, he's walking, he walks back to his flat. It's quiet, it's empty, there's nothing there, it's a dingy stuff.

Kev: 10:17
Walking down a quiet street doesn't mean you've got no money.

Rob: 10:19
Yeah, but when you get to the flat, you realise it's a bed set. Yeah. He's slumming it. He's slumming it, thank you.

Kev: 10:25
He's struggling. Alright, he's struggling.

Rob: 10:27
But as every artist, he's clearly very talented.

Kev: 10:31
Very talented. What are his eyes like?

Rob: 10:34
A little bit dead. He's dead behind the eyes. Like every singer.

Kev: 10:41
How many professions can we disparage in the course of a few episodes?

Rob: 10:46
All true artists are troubled.

Kev: 10:47
Okay. Is he gonna die at the age of twenty-seven? Loads of our uh big artists died at twenty-seven, aren't they?

Rob: 10:52
I I think he's already past twenty-seven. Oh crap. Sorry about that. That's a shame. What is that significant?

Kev: 10:57
That's a thing, isn't it? Um you know uh was it Amy Winehouse, Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Buckley? No. All died at the age of twenty-seven. Oh right, okay. It's a thing. Three people. There's more. I can't remember them off the top of my head. There's loads, though. There's loads in the club.

Rob: 11:14
Two pack?

Kev: 11:15
Maybe.

Rob: 11:19
Why are we going straight into the death of Nick? He's just he's just left a great gig.

Kev: 11:24
Yeah, as a footnote. Well, an empty gig though. Or not an empty gig.

Rob: 11:27
He's just left a gig. This isn't the one they're reporting on. Right.

Kev: 11:29
This is a different gig. Okay. W Can he foresee a bloody crime of passion? Brilliant.

Rob: 11:36
Hold that thought. Crime of passion, yes.

Kev: 11:38
A bloody crime of passion.

Rob: 11:40
The next scene is him waking up from a nightmare. Okay. And the nightmare is A bloody crime of passion. A memory of a scuffle with a friend, and it didn't end well. And it was a very emotional scuffle because it started as a crime of passion. As a crime of passion about the songs.

Kev: 11:59
About the songs.

Rob: 11:60
About the songs.

Kev: 12:00
He's a friend who's in the band, is he? No. Oh, okay. A friend who wrote the songs. Oh well, Nick's songs. Yeah, okay.

Rob: 12:09
May I may telegraph that one a little bit. A touch. But yeah, the he he wakes up, there's a he wakes up from night night sweats. He's had this horrible nightmare where him and his friend were scuffling about the songs.

Kev: 12:22
Okay.

Rob: 12:22
He has a whiskey, maybe some illicit drugs.

Kev: 12:24
Yep. Ideally so. Goes back to bed.

Rob: 12:28
Okay. Next morning, the magazine releases its episode. There's loads of episodes. Do the magazines come in episodes? EMagazines do I think you call it an edition. Probably, yeah. It's an edition. Yeah. And there's loads of buzz about footnote and specifically Nick. Social media's blowing up. Right. They're absolutely buzzing, he can't believe it. He assures them, no, don't worry, it's a phase, it'll pass. But he doesn't seem very happy.

Kev: 13:01
Why isn't he happy? I wonder. We could introduce a few reasons for him to be unhappy if you like.

Rob: 13:08
Please make them fair.

Kev: 13:09
Before we go any further. I mean, you you might remember I mentioned about what his eyes were like. Yeah. Is there a lot of retinal scanning involved in your story?

Rob: 13:20
To get into his dingy apartment. There's a retina. A retina dis Retinal scanning.

Kev: 13:27
Yeah, well, just just know for now. Can his friend that he dreamed about? Can he be called Leo Crow? Please?

Rob: 13:34
Yeah.

Kev: 13:35
It's a good name. He doesn't have a name, but it's kind of a music name, it's a rock name, isn't it? Leo Crow.

Rob: 13:39
Leo Crow. Yeah, it's not as good as Nick's songs.

Kev: 13:43
It makes me laugh every time as well. I reckon Leo Crow could be Cheryl Crow's son. You don't know who Cheryl Crow is he. I think I've heard of it. Is she an actor? No, she's a singer. Did she die at 27? Right, so Leo Crow is there. Yeah. Not there. He's a dream. Yeah, it's the dream word. Leo Crow, presumably at this point in the film, is, you know, ancient history. Okay. Right, so he has woken up, the whole thing's exploding, it's kicking off, but he's unhappy about it somehow. Is it is that because he's fighting with uh traumatic past?

Rob: 14:16
Absolutely, Kev.

Kev: 14:18
Okay, good. In which his son gets abducted and his wife leaves him because he's a wreck of a man? Or not because of that.

Rob: 14:23
So do I have to do I have to wind this into my story?

Kev: 14:26
Not all of it. I mean choose the fits you want to keep.

Rob: 14:28
So what was the option?

Kev: 14:29
Could it be set in 2054?

Rob: 14:33
Yes.

Rob: 14:34
I mean could be. Does social media still exist? Retinal scanning makes more sense in the world. I've not been there. You you said about his wife left him and his son.

Kev: 14:44
Yeah. Well he lost where his son, yeah.

Rob: 14:46
Yeah, it's the opposite.

Kev: 14:48
Nick Crow has left his daughter. Nick Crow? There is no Nick Crow. Nick Songs. Yep, no. There's Leo Crow Crow Crow has left his daughter. Has left his daughter.

Rob: 14:60
We'll get to that.

Kev: 15:01
Alright, okay. So Leo Crow, the previously sort of tangential character, clearly has a broader part to play in the film as it goes on. Alright, okay. So we'll see more of Leo Crow in a bit.

Rob: 15:12
Very quickly rewriting my notes here. So over the next few days, the the buzz grows around Footnote. Yep. There's more and more people attending the gigs and they go from supporting act to a main act. In Washington, DC, of course. Where was it set?

Kev: 15:27
Washington, DC.

Rob: 15:28
Yeah, I thought so, yeah. You haven't mentioned it, but I'm I'm telling you, it's it was going to be say Washington State, but it's easy it's easy enough to change.

Kev: 15:37
Washington DC is not in Washington State.

Rob: 15:39
We can we can go with Washington, DC. Doesn't help or change anything, but that's fine.

Kev: 15:43
No, but would it help to know that the homicide rate has reached epidemic proportions in Washington, DC, and local law enforcement are having to take drastic measures?

Rob: 15:52
I can come back to that as well. Let's put a pin in that as well.

Kev: 15:55
Alright, we'll put a pin in that.

Rob: 15:57
Because that could be the reason of how we got to where we are.

Kev: 15:60
Okay. But I'm going to get to that. Alright, make sure you come back to it because I will push the point. Who else is going to be in this film, incidentally? You got any other actors? I mean, are there any other main parts that need casting?

Rob: 16:11
Not really. There's there's the other bandmates, but they're incidental, but it's a bit of a one-man show, though.

Kev: 16:15
Well, there's no I don't know. Well, maybe maybe Leo Crow. Well, Leo Crow needs needs a an actor.

Rob: 16:20
Leo Crow needs an actor. Very quite a small acting part for such a big role.

Kev: 16:24
So Right, so it's a an important role. But quite a small part. But relatively small. The kind of thing that could win you an Oscar as best supporting male. Absolutely. It didn't in minority report, incidentally, for anyone. No.

Rob: 16:35
But it could, but it's that sort of size role. I think there's also going to be like an online sleuth. Is that the right word? Okay. Conspiracy theorist.

Kev: 16:44
Oh, a wacky right-wing nut job.

Rob: 16:46
Well, yeah, one of them. I'm imagining Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter films. Okay. This is just a bit weird. Okay. Yeah, so she's online. Anyway, we'll get to that. Stop stop distracting me from this great thing.

Kev: 16:60
Come on, go on with it then.

Rob: 17:01
There's more people attending the gigs, they've become more popular. We see clips of Spotify streaming going through the roof, they're going up in the charts, everyone loves the songs, the money's coming in finally. Yeah. But then it happens. One tweet that changes everything. One tweet that changes everything. From Luna Lovegood.

Kev: 17:20
Yep. Go on. Watch out because JK Rowling is is not keen on any use of the side.

Rob: 17:25
So I'll just switch the the initials round so we all the tweet says I'm sure I've heard this song before. And Nick Songs is not happy.

Kev: 17:38
This is a Natalie and Brulia torn sort of situation. Or an Ed Shearan he was at the centre of a thing recently, wasn't he? It gets deeper than this though. Oh it gets deeper.

Rob: 17:47
Because it turns out, yeah, it's it's literally thickening as we speak. Turns out that Nick Nick Songs has nicked the songs. Nick Nick's songs. He's nicked the songs from a friend. Oh, not Leo Crow. Leo Crow. Ooh. The guy he was having a dream about in the scuffle.

Kev: 18:06
My word, every day is a winding road.

Rob: 18:08
Yeah, I think that's a that's a that's a song.

Kev: 18:10
It's a Cheryl Crow song. I've heard it. Go me. I think that's a Cheryl Crow song. It might not be.

Rob: 18:22
So um Twitter actually finds an old video of Leo Crow. Is that right? Singing the songs back in the day. Oh, have we got a name for the song?

Kev: 18:31
It's can we call it Sick Stick?

Rob: 18:34
Sick stick?

Kev: 18:35
Yeah, that that appears in minority reports quite well. I mean it's not a song. Well you could have other names. Uh Everybody Runs. That'd be quite good.

Rob: 18:43
Everybody runs, that could be the kind of theme of the film. Alright, Everybody Runs is going to be the song that he's That can be a bit of an anthem for Nick's Nick's songs, actually. So it turns out that um the Nick's friend was actually killed in the scuffle that Nick had a nightmare about. And it was actually the scuffle with Nick. Yeah, it was a flashback in his nightmare.

Kev: 19:02
Son of a gun. So he's a murderer.

Rob: 19:04
We didn't see him commit the crime.

Kev: 19:07
Well, also I suppose if it's a crime of passion, is it murder or is that manslaughter? Well, I don't really know that. Do you know the difference legally between?

Rob: 19:14
I've got a section underlined and it says ending. I think we should put a pin in that. Okay, alright. Can you remind me of all the things I've got a pin to be?

Kev: 19:21
You've got a fair few pins going on here.

Rob: 19:24
So it turns out that the scuffle that he woke up in a in a hot sweat, cold sweat about was the scuffle that killed his friend. And as part of that interaction, Nick nicked the songs and left the scene and fled town. Ooh, so he's committing a murder and is on the run. He's on the run. He's been living low. And we've now find out in this scene.

Kev: 19:47
Did he have to change his eyeballs to escape detection?

Rob: 19:53
Yes. I was just about to say the crime scene, he got a big thing. But not before he left the crime scene. He didn't murder Tom and then changed his eyeballs before he left.

Kev: 20:05
That'd be madness.

Rob: 20:06
Before he left the crime scene, he scooped out Leo's eyeballs.

Kev: 20:10
So he's not just nicked his tongue, he's nicked his eyeballs.

Kev: 20:18
So he's taken out his he's scooped out the eye.

Rob: 20:22
Savage. You've brought it again.

Kev: 20:24
This film is perfectly surgical procedure. It didn't have to be he scooped out someone's eyes.

Rob: 20:30
Alright, before he left, he took some very high profile high detail photos of Leo's eyes so he could replicate them. Boring. Sorry, do you want to go back to the scooping them out with a teaspoon?

Kev: 20:40
Yeah, a little bit. I mean, last week you had a dog.

Rob: 20:43
No.

Kev: 20:44
Razor blading another dog's ear. I had a dog in a Disney film, so you introduced razor blades. Well, again. Quentin Tarantino did. I stand by that.

Rob: 20:53
But I think the important thing is, regardless of whether he spoons out the eyeballs or takes a high-res photo, he he's been living low. Yeah. And this newfound fame is going to expose him.

Kev: 21:03
Oh no, so he's trying. That's why he was so not keen earlier on, is it?

Rob: 21:09
It's all coming full circle.

Kev: 21:11
The minority reporters really brought him high profile. Yep.

Rob: 21:15
Ironically. But that's exactly what the But that was the purpose. That was what the magazine episode wanted to do. Okay. Uh but the Twitter detectives, uh the sleuths online, they find all this out. And there's now a big conspiracy online brewing without Nick really knowing. So it's all going on in the background. And we know about it. Right. He knows what he's done. There's going to be some sort of collision at some point. I see.

Kev: 21:39
So there's there's these two strands, which is in the present both in the present. Yep. One of which is him experiencing this new fame with his uh with his band. Yep. And the other which is this Runa Rovgood. Runa Rovgood online in some dark corner of the internet. Yep. Sleuthing away with a bunch of other amateur finding out that.

Rob: 22:01
Leo Clark, what was he called? Leo Crow.

Kev: 22:03
Leo Crow was um who was found with his eyes brutally scooped out and was or photographed and and videos of him singing these songs.

Rob: 22:12
Yeah, of course. So an unsolved murder and somebody's Nicky songs.

Kev: 22:16
Could the videos of the songs be implausibly consistently shown on Nokia devices?

Rob: 22:28
Does Nokia In 2054? Yeah, well yeah. That must age minority at all because I should.

Kev: 22:35
Nokia was clearly a heavy sponsor of the original film. That means it's 25 years old at least. Uh more or less exactly that, I would guess. Yeah, I haven't actually looked up what year it was. But I can confirm that every day is a winding road was indeed by Cheryl Craft. Says Google. Well, yeah.

Rob: 22:52
Yeah, basically. I think Nokia must still have a smartphone. And when we're seeing the tweets, we're seeing them on a Nokia smart device. Easy, yeah.

Kev: 23:03
Are they tweets in 2054? I mean they're X at the very least. Are they still tweets?

Rob: 23:08
They've gone back to Twitter in 2054.

Kev: 23:10
Are are things on X called tweets still though? Well what else would they be called? Well I don't know. X is?

Rob: 23:16
No, they're definitely still called tweets. And if they're not, I'm bringing them.

Kev: 23:19
I mean, I haven't got anything to do with X personally. Um not a not a sponsorship opportunity for us. I'm not no comment.

Rob: 23:28
So at the next gig, Nick Songs goes, he comes out on stage, and just as he does, the police arrive and arrest him.

Kev: 23:34
So he just he's hang on, let's put some context to this. He's just finished singing their biggest hit at the end. Yeah. Everybody runs. Everybody runs. Cops come in. Cops come in. Does he run? Do they say you can't run? He runs. And he says everybody runs.

Rob: 23:49
Yeah, that's exactly what happens. And everyone laughs, thinking it's some sort of act.

Kev: 23:53
Yeah.

Rob: 23:54
And then they chase him. And catch him. He goes.

Kev: 23:57
And then they press a stick under his chin that makes him vomit. Yes, the vomit stick. Is that a vomit stick? The six stick, yeah.

Rob: 24:05
The six stick.

Kev: 24:06
Give them the six stick.

Rob: 24:06
Yeah, why not? 2054 anything can happen. Exactly. Anything can happen. So they don't have tasers in 2054.

Kev: 24:13
No, it's like a directed taser on a button.

Rob: 24:16
Specifically to make people vomit.

Kev: 24:17
Yeah.

Rob: 24:19
Yeah, weave that in quite well, I think.

Kev: 24:20
Yeah, it's easy really. I mean I did it for you, but yeah.

Rob: 24:24
So as you can imagine, in 2054, when social media is still up and running, uh viral video of the gig, him being arrested. There's loads of conspiracy theories online. This is just increasing the exposure of fame and all the stories about him, and everyone's going mad about whether it's true or not.

Kev: 24:44
His legend is growing. His legend is growing. But he has been captured at this, but he's been arrested, has he?

Rob: 24:50
Yeah, he's going we're going into we've kind of left the middle of the film now. He's definitely been captured.

Kev: 24:55
Okay, so his band's done.

Rob: 24:56
For now. His band's done. But um we're now going into the uh the the section of the film which is no montages, don't worry. Good. But he's learning. He uh we spend about ten minutes of him choosing a defence lawyer. Amazing. And a copyright lawyer. Yeah. No, no, he hires defence lawyers and copyright lawyers.

Kev: 25:16
A bit like Ed Shearing.

Rob: 25:18
And goes into a court case on two fronts a murder charge and a copyright theft charge. But they're both just concurrently. Concurrently, yeah.

Kev: 25:26
You're up for murder, but we're also going to pursue this copyright claim.

Rob: 25:29
Separately.

Kev: 25:30
Right. A copyright charge isn't a le that's not a a prosecution thing, though, is it? That must be a civil suit.

Rob: 25:36
Yeah, yeah, of course. From who?

Kev: 25:37
From Leo Crow's eye sockets.

Rob: 25:40
From the estate of Leo Crowe. The estate of Leo Crow. Who's Cheryl Crow's son? Don't forget, he left his daughter.

Kev: 25:48
Cheryl Crow's granddaughter.

Rob: 25:51
Cheryl Crow Jr. She's gonna be called Cheryl. He left his daughter, not intentionally, he left his daughter when he died. No. So technically. Oh, so when you didn't leave. Okay, right, yeah, okay. You've done me that so there is an estate of uh Leo Crow and Cheryl, his daughter, is the one leading up. Named after her you know grandmother and her great comma grandma.

Kev: 26:17
A great amazing musician grandma.

Rob: 26:20
Okay. There is there is a bit of a court case about the murder, but there's ultimately no evidence.

Kev: 26:27
If it makes you happy That's another one. That's a Cheryl Crow.

Rob: 26:33
I can't keep up whether this is minority report or Cheryl Crow at this point.

Kev: 26:37
It's minority report with Sheryl Crow.

Rob: 26:38
I feel like I've been double teamed.

Kev: 26:40
Minority report with Sheryl Crow up next on ABC. It's just a little politics programme, I reckon. With Sheryl Crow, minority report on ABC.

Rob: 26:51
I just like the accents. I forget you can do accents.

Kev: 26:54
Well they're they all sound more or less exactly the same.

Rob: 26:57
Still fun to hear. Um so essentially Nick Songs, despite his name being a crime. He walks free. He walks free.

Kev: 27:07
Well of both of both things?

Rob: 27:08
Of both things. So how do you nick something that's can't you can't be proved that it's uh Leo Crows?

Kev: 27:15
Well I th but people have found the video of the.

Rob: 27:18
Yeah, but it's not proof, he's just singing it. It's a song, yeah.

Kev: 27:21
It's just a song who knows who wrote it. Right. So basically Nick's defence is now I wrote it and Leo sang it. Yeah. So he he disparages Leo's name a little bit. Is it Leo?

Rob: 27:30
I keep on thinking. Yeah, Leo Crown.

Kev: 27:32
Yeah, Cheryl's son.

Rob: 27:35
He keeps he keeps on disparaging his name and saying basically it's my song and it or it was our song. Oh careful. Our song.

Kev: 27:42
That's a that's Elton John. Don't bring please don't bring another artist into this.

Rob: 27:47
Uh so he walks through, there's no there's no evidence uh for the murder charge, uh essentially.

Kev: 27:53
Is he is he gonna run from the police again at any point? No, I think it's because then you're gonna really struggle to get this part in. Uh he's gotta run from somebody. So do you want to know why?

Rob: 28:05
Go on.

Kev: 28:05
Because in uh a lengthy chase scene, um he's got to be sort of fighting with someone on a fully automated vehicle assembly line, uh, which miraculously builds a car around him which he then escapes in.

Rob: 28:19
You're making this too easy.

Kev: 28:22
I won't hold you to that, but you don't have to put that in. That is one of the more ridiculous parts of minority report. Spoiler of that.

Rob: 28:27
I do like the thought of him having to work a more regular job. On the assembly line. While he's while he's funding his court.

Kev: 28:34
Yeah, we can have that then, can't we?

Rob: 28:35
So yeah, and then there's people know who he is, they're chasing him for autographs because he was so they found which car factory he's working in. Until the copyright so he's he's been freed of murder, yeah, but until the copyright court case is settled, yeah, he can't sing the songs. Well he's got an injunction out or something. So he's got to go on the the factory line to to earn the cash to pay for the copyright. Okay. So to then start singing the songs. And there's great news for Nick. Go on. He wins both of his cases. Wins both of them. So he's free to sing songs. He makes loads of money from his fame, and he does he does just that. Yeah, he lives the dream. But his lifestyle doesn't change.

Kev: 29:18
Oh, because of some some guilt or something, I imagine, is it?

Rob: 29:22
He still lives in a small empty bedset.

Kev: 29:25
Uh with a fridge full of moldy foods.

Rob: 29:28
Yeah, and loads of whiskey and illicit. And whiskey, of course, yeah. And he does that as punishment for himself, because actually ultimately he does blame himself, even though he wasn't found guilty. Mm-hmm. And he does feel guilt towards Cheryl Crow Jr.'s dad. That's the most random way of getting to him. Even though he's been found innocent, he did bespear his name and he knows deep down what he's done. And the all the money he's making, go and ask me what happens to that.

Kev: 29:55
Oh, I can hardly guess. What happens to all the money he's making?

Rob: 29:59
Trust fund. No. For who? Cleo Cleo Cheryl Crow Jr. Cheryl Crow Jr.

Kev: 30:06
Who has managed to burn through all of the money that Sheryl Crow Sr. left her family and estate.

Rob: 30:12
To be fair to me, and I will defend this point, that wasn't in my film, and Cheryl Crow I don't think is in my narrative report.

Kev: 30:20
She's absolutely not.

Rob: 30:21
So that is a curveball that nobody was expecting.

Kev: 30:23
Yeah, that's what I'm least of all me. And I don't even really remember because of Leo Crow, who is in, yeah, that's it. Leo Crow. I remember where we're talking about it. Yeah, we did. Um so you know Runa Rovgood. Yeah. Runa Rovgood, could she be one of a set of triplets? Yeah. Could that the triplets maybe all be The Rovgoods? The Rovgoods The Rovgoods, the Rovgood trio. Could they be the people on the dark corners of the internet who've been finding it out? Could there be more than a hint of clairvoyance around their discovery?

Rob: 30:58
I I think what I forgot to mention was actually Leo Crow had triplets.

Kev: 31:03
No, no, I think they've got to be different people. They've got to be different. Yeah, I think they I think your film would be better if they're sort of disconnected and they're just picking up on vibes through the ether.

Rob: 31:14
Alright, then yeah. They're picking up on vibes through the ether. Vibes through the ether. Runa RovGood. There's three of them.

Kev: 31:19
In advance as well, before it even happens. They've got to be slightly clairvoyant.

Rob: 31:26
So I've got to crowbar three Well no, I've told you where they where they fit.

Kev: 31:30
That's how they find out. But I've got to say You know the one who says, I'm sure I've heard this song before. Yeah, Runa. She actually says it before it even happened.

Rob: 31:38
So she tweets that before his fame. Yeah. Right, okay, yeah, yeah. Because her one of one of her triplet sisters told her to do it.

Kev: 31:45
Well, because they've seen it already. They've seen it happen.

Rob: 31:47
And what, they can they can be somewhere and the other one can see it through them?

Kev: 31:51
Yeah, they can tell the future somehow.

Rob: 31:52
Yeah. I mean when you come to score this at the end, please remove this bit because this is just you ruining my great film.

Kev: 31:58
Well no, I mean this is minority report si merging seamlessly with your minority report. I mean I I think it it's quite a nice idea to have these three mysteriously linked triplet twins.

Rob: 32:11
Triplet twins? Is that what they're called? Triplets.

Kev: 32:14
Triplets, thank you. Well, yeah, triplet twins.

Rob: 32:17
I think they need to be connected to Triplet twins might be six of them. To Sheryl Crow Jr.

Kev: 32:22
Yeah, well they can be connected, but they just can't she can't be they can't be direct descendants of Leo Crow, I don't think. I think it'd be better if they I regret that statement.

Rob: 32:29
Yeah. I think they need to be connected and somehow protecting there without her knowing.

Kev: 32:34
So there's more than a hint, really, of questions about free will and determinism in your own.

Rob: 32:42
I've seen Free Willy.

Kev: 32:44
It's another film we've seen, Freewilly.

Rob: 32:46
There you go. Actually, I think.

Kev: 32:48
I did not know there was a Freewilly 3. I mean, by the third time you'd have thought the police would have caught up with them. We can't go into Freewilly.

Rob: 32:56
We can't go into I'm just distracting you now.

Kev: 32:58
Alright. Well, uh anything else you want to add to that? Have you reached sort of the end of the thing?

Rob: 33:03
That's that's the end. Uh a happy ending for Sheryl Crow Jr.

Kev: 33:07
Excellent. We avoided montages. Yeah, we did. We really had to work hard to avoid montages. Yeah. You've managed to put in a few key um pieces of information that we've sort of forced a little bit. Um but I think you've done that quite well. So in summary, Nick Songs Nick Songs. Who was if effectively born to Nick Songs. Yeah. Um you know that's it's I suppose he would be Nicholas Songs, really.

Rob: 33:33
Maybe it's a stage name. Nicky.

Kev: 33:34
Nicky songs.

Rob: 33:35
Maybe it's his guilty guilty conscience coming out as a stage name.

Kev: 33:39
Could be.

Rob: 33:40
Could be. And he really wants to get caught. He's a deep character.

Kev: 33:45
Ooh. There is a good quote that I'd like to put in somewhere if we can. You ready? I can't wait.

Rob: 33:50
Is it gonna be uh an accent?

Kev: 33:52
I I mean it could be it could be a copyright avoiding uh accent one if you want. Yeah, looking forward to this. There we go. Careful chief, you dig up the past, all you get is dirty.

Rob: 34:03
Oh, it's Peter Kay, was it? Peter K, I mean. I I think I think that's when when they're going back to try and find out whether he's whether he's scooped out Leo Clark's eyeball.

Kev: 34:19
Maybe Tom Cruise could say that. Careful chief, you do get the past all you get is dirty, because it's like saying, Well, don't go looking into this. And he's not ri it's not chief like a chief of police he's talking to, it's just like a kind of it's a chief of police that Nick Songs is talking to. And he's warning the chief that's a risky point.

Rob: 34:34
No, no, no. He's warning that look, he's really popular online, and the people online will do dangerous things if if his songs are stopped. So he's saying to the chief, look, what happens when I'd stop singing? Be warned.

Kev: 34:47
You don't want to see what happens when I stop singing.

Rob: 34:50
You don't want the Twitter mob after you.

Kev: 34:52
When the fat lady sings, or the fairly muscular lean man stops singing. It's exactly the same. Okay, well, I mean, we've got to the end of Rob's frankly ludicrous story. I quite like that. I don't know why he insisted on setting it in 2054. Or scooping out the why did he scoop out the where did the eyeballs? We didn't put we didn't come back to that. We were sticking a pin in that.

Rob: 35:17
The the eyeballs, I thought this was quite obvious. Yeah. I thought it was quite obvious. The the songs that he nicked were in a safe protected by eyeballs, so he needed the retina to get into the eyeball to get to the safe.

Kev: 35:30
So he he didn't know the songs already?

Rob: 35:32
Didn't know the chords.

Kev: 35:34
Didn't know the chords.

Rob: 35:36
I don't even know if that makes sense, but I'm sticking with it.

Kev: 35:40
He only knew C, G, and D.

Kev: 35:43
I'm sticking with it. Hadn't heard of the letter F. So you can play that.

Kev: 35:48
He needed to get into the safe of Leo Crow that was locked by retinal scanner to see which chords he needed for the song. The hit song, remember, Everybody Runs. Everybody runs. Which of course Rob is about to sing us a line from now.

Rob: 36:04
I think we should release that as a Christmas single.

Kev: 36:06
Yeah, I think there's a lot of legs in that. Maybe we get Cheryl Crow to Junior. Maybe we get Cheryl Crow to guest on it. On Everybody Runs. I think it's time to score this madness. Can't wait. Um and as always, there are three categories, and as always, I've slightly forgotten what they are. So coherence is the first one. Um it was actually, and I think this is because you've sort of wrote the story in advance, it was quite coherent. I'm not sh I mean, does he have to be called Nick's songs, really? I think that's the most entertaining part.

Rob: 36:42
You can't take that away from me.

Kev: 36:44
It was it was sort of coherent. There was there was this this crime in the past that he's already, you know, we're already learning about early on in the film.

Rob: 36:52
No montages.

Kev: 36:53
Without montages um mercifully. We see his past. We see I mean, I think the the minority report that comes out from from the magazine did the it's an appropriate title, weirdly, even though it's such a tiny part of the film, because without that minority report, none of it would have happened. So it's a pivotal moment. Yep. It's a butterfly effect. It's a butterfly effect. Have you seen the butterfly effect? Okay. That we could do that in another week, actually. So coherence-wise, this is arguably your strongest effort yet.

Rob: 37:27
I'm showing signs of improvement.

Kev: 37:29
Yes, um, but from a low, low bar. Um coherence-wise, I do feel it would be a bit harsh to mark you down on some of the elements I made you put in. I'm gonna give you eight for coherence today. I'm liking it. Yeah, yeah, well.

Rob: 37:47
I'm I'm feeling confident for today. I reckon this is gonna be my best score ever.

Kev: 37:50
I think it might be. Coherence was strong, that's eight. Entertainment factor. It part of it depends on how much of a amazing tune everybody runs is.

Rob: 38:03
We we just listen to that a lot in the film.

Kev: 38:05
Yeah, well, you know, if we can really enjoy everybody runs, then I feel it could be strong. I like the slight element of mystery that you could if you were a good director, which obviously you wouldn't be, but if you were, I like that area that m overlap of mystery past and that slight tension about the future. I'll give it a s a solid seven for entertainment.

Rob: 38:29
I think you're gonna watch this film at some point.

Kev: 38:31
Well, you know, maybe. We're at fifteen, and then the final one, which I always originality.

Rob: 38:39
Name one film that's like that.

Kev: 38:41
Well n okay, well the the there's a reason films aren't like this. Yeah, that's a fair point. Um but originality. There's not too many I mean, you've got your down on his luck singer addicted to whiskey and some illicit drugs. Yeah. With a tortured past. I'd say that's pretty run-of-the-mill.

Rob: 39:00
I think that's just character scene. That's just character setting though, isn't it?

Kev: 39:03
Yeah, yeah, it's lazy character setting, but yeah.

Rob: 39:05
Um every uh what does it say, every artist is flawed? I think that's that rings true, doesn't it?

Kev: 39:14
Yeah, I suppose. There you go. Are they all flawed? Well, I mean everyone's flawed. So it's a pretty vacuous statement, isn't it? Name any human without flaws.

Rob: 39:24
Cheryl Crow.

Kev: 39:25
Cheryl Crowe. Senior or junior? Junior. So I mean that's that's not too bad. It's quite original, I suppose. I'll give it a six. Smash this. What's that?

Rob: 39:39
Um twenty-four.

Kev: 39:40
Uh no. Eight plus seven plus six is not twenty-four. Do you want another go?

Kev: 39:48
Twenty-one.

Kev: 39:49
Twenty-one. Twenty-one out of thirty. Sorry, I can do math.

Rob: 39:52
I just took the numbers down wrong.

Kev: 39:54
Oh, okay, right. What did you take down to get 21 uh 24? 9, 8, 7. Most of those numbers were never mentioned.

Rob: 40:01
Can we not distract from the fact 21 is a very good score?

Kev: 40:04
21 is a good score. This is definitely the film that you've come up with that I would have the most interest in, especially if we stripped it from being in 2054 and brought it back to the modern day. Especially if we took all I'm surprised you went down that futuristic sci-fi sort of route, to be honest. That's it was a bit of a weird direction to take.

Rob: 40:20
Cost me points, but yeah. I think it can be said in the future.

Kev: 40:25
I mean, it's a story, it's a it's a tale as old as time. You said it whenever you like, hard up, down on his luck artist, somehow explodes from somewhere, discovers that actually in the past he's nicked songs because of his name. Um murdered his friend, makes it big, doesn't really like making it big because of all that stuff. Um, but somehow gets away with it. Does he get away? He does get away with it. Oh yeah, but then he he He's troubled. He's troubled and he doesn't. Oh yeah, that ending is a bit lacking in originality. I've taken it down when it gets down to five. Um you're at twenty. Stop speaking. I forgot about the part where he's like, oh no, he's too racked with guilt and he's gonna give it all away as a way of like making up for it. It'd be much better if he was just an all-out villain. He scooped someone's eyeballs out earlier. He's not why is he suddenly guilty about Sheryl Crow Jr.? Why does he give a toss about Sheryl Crow Jr.?

Rob: 41:14
Because he's besp I'm not talking, because I'm you're just gonna mark me down more.

Kev: 41:19
Well, I might mark you down more for not backing up your your uh work. Because Marketing's part of a film's release, yeah.

Rob: 41:27
Crime of passion when he scooped out the eyeballs. Yeah. Because he was desperate for the songs, but then he he grows up, he learns what the the price of fame is, and he doesn't want that so much anymore. And actually, he's come to learn that there's more to life than just fame.

Kev: 41:44
Yeah, okay, right. Beautiful. So now he goes off and starts his own MLM like like all the other no.

Rob: 41:52
Yeah, what's an MLM?

Kev: 41:53
Oh dear. Rob will go away and find out about middle-aged women and their MLMs. Um Right. Okay, so 20 out of 30, not bad. Uh two-thirds. Two-thirds, exactly, on the nose. Hang on, haven't we scored you've scored that before? Yeah, because I generate I genuinely made one that we could tie on and then you made yours out of four. So let's get well I'll give it back to twenty-one. That was my original thought. 21. It's your best effort, yeah. It is the best story yet that you've come up with.

Rob: 42:21
On a technicality.

Kev: 42:22
On a technicality. So I'll take it. Well, to be fair, I took one away on a on a whim. So I put it back on the technicality.

Rob: 42:28
The whim's the same as a can we lock that in before I tell you my next thing. It's 21. So Mr. Nick Songs. Yep. I also had a funny name for the character in the other film as well.

Kev: 42:38
What was the other film again, remind me?

Rob: 42:40
A charismatic substitute teacher.

Kev: 42:42
Yes. Yes.

Rob: 42:43
And his name was Professor Ian Spire.

Kev: 42:45
Oh God. Ian Spire. I'm glad we didn't go down that route. Right.

Rob: 42:50
For next time avoid these names. In brackets.

Kev: 42:54
Inspire, in case you didn't pick up on it in case it was too subtle. Rob is a director who really trusts the audience.

Rob: 43:05
Both of them names.

Kev: 43:06
Alright. Right, so a solid 21 out of 30 for minority report.

Rob: 43:10
I'm delighted with that.

Kev: 43:11
Brilliant. Right, what have you got for me this week? Oh, yeah, I've got a quiz. Well, I'm assuming you have. I didn't actually check before we started. It's entirely possible you didn't.

Rob: 43:18
Yeah, despite spending most of my week coming up with funny names for characters.

Kev: 43:22
If it took you most of the week to come up with Ian Spire and Nick Songs, your week has been wasted.

Rob: 43:27
I was really happy with Nick Songs. I've got an odd one out quiz. Oh, odd one out. So um there's actually three questions, and you get a point for the correct answer, and a point if you can say why as well.

Kev: 43:40
Okay.

Rob: 43:41
So I can get six points. Six points up for grabs, yeah. Alright, go ahead. All about TV. Not necessarily a TV show, I'm about characters. Okay. So uh Let's do this. First question is which of these is the odd one out and why?

Kev: 43:54
But the well they're all that's the qu that all of the questions are that. You told me that already. Okay, great.

Rob: 44:01
Number one, K9 from Doctor Who. Yep. Bender Dog from Future Armour. Robot, yeah. Sheldon Cooper from the Big Bang Theory.

Kev: 44:09
Well he's not a robot, is he?

Rob: 44:10
Yep.

Kev: 44:11
So he's quite robotic character.

Rob: 44:18
Right. This might be too easy. So that's two out of two for you so far. Get in. Let's hope these next two are more difficult. So which of these is the odd one out? That's me. I didn't see that coming. I didn't that wasn't a joke. I just did that naturally. Oh good. Number one, Fraser.

Kev: 44:38
Fraser or Fraser?

Rob: 44:39
Fraser.

Kev: 44:40
Fraser played by Kelsey Grammar in Seattle. Yep.

Rob: 44:44
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom. That one.

Kev: 44:47
Yeah, okay, yeah.

Rob: 44:48
Number two, cheers. And number three, Grey's Anatomy.

Kev: 44:52
Oh now. I think Cheers are set in Boston, Fraser's set in Seattle, and I think Grey's Anatomy is also set in Seattle.

Rob: 44:59
Yeah, that's a worry.

Kev: 45:00
So it's gonna be Cheers and Boston. Alright. Yep, that is four out of four. We're flying here. Two thirds. Two thirds. Can I before you say which of these is the odd one out and why, you don't need to.

Rob: 45:14
I've written it down though.

Kev: 45:16
You'd better say it.

Rob: 45:18
Which of these is the odd one out and why? Number one, dinner ladies. Victoria Wood. Number two, Coronation Street. And number three, Faulty Towers.

Kev: 45:30
Dinner Ladies and Coronation Street set in Manchester, Faulty Towers set in Torquay. So Faulty Towers is set in Torquay.

Rob: 45:38
You've got the right answer.

Kev: 45:40
And a correct answer.

Rob: 45:46
Okay. But it wasn't the actual answer I was hoping.

Kev: 45:49
Actually, it was Dinner Ladies set in Manchester. Because wasn't the premise of Dinner Ladies it was actually a sitcom itself? Or was I think am I thinking something else?

Rob: 45:58
Yep. So it was set in Manchester.

Kev: 46:00
No, I tell you, I'm thinking of a totally different show. It was set in Manchester and it was just a run of the mill dinner ladies comedy with Victoria Wood.

Kev: 46:06
Run of the Mill? Well it's hurtful.

Kev: 46:08
Well that's because you're from the north. So you next you'll be telling me gravy is the best drink.

Rob: 46:14
Bovrol. Yeah, you you've got it right. And I did I did write down I'd accept Manchester, but the the actual answer was that Thelma Barlow wasn't in Faulty Towers.

Kev: 46:26
Thelma Barlow? Is that a character from Coronation Street?

Rob: 46:30
She plays Mavis in Coronation Street and she plays Dolly in Didn't Ladies and Blue.

Kev: 46:35
Okay, well there you go. But I still got a perfectly good connection.

Rob: 46:38
I've made these two. So I got 100% then reading a win again. Again, I'm I'm feeling quite down about that because I've made them too easy. I mean you answered the robot question before I'd even finished. Yeah, well, but robot dog. And then we actually we all we talked about Seattle in the main bit. Did we? Yeah. Well no, we talked about Washington. Seattle's in Washington, same thing.

Kev: 46:59
And what state is Washington, DC?

Rob: 47:02
It's its own state, isn't it? I don't think so. Is it not is it not separate? I don't know.

Kev: 47:08
District of Columbia. That's what the DC bit stands for, isn't it?

Rob: 47:11
Well it sounds like a district. Is it and is it is it not is it not in?

Kev: 47:16
It doesn't matter where Washington is, let's be fair. It doesn't matter.

Rob: 47:19
Let's talk more about Thelma Barlow.

Kev: 47:22
Right. Okay, and on that on that bombshell. It's probably time to call an end to minority report. Yeah. Um which uh hopefully the listeners might have enjoyed. My version, I think, is cracking. It's your strongest effort, yeah. Yeah. Your strongest effort yet.

Rob: 47:37
Do I get to know what I'm doing next week?

Kev: 47:39
Yes. This week, though, I thought I might give you a choice. Largely because I I haven't checked whether you know these films or not yet. Uh so I thought I'd prepare to. Have you seen Training Day?

Rob: 47:54
No. Have you heard of it? Um Is Denzel Washington in there?

Kev: 47:59
He is.

Rob: 48:01
If I pick that, I'm gonna hamstring myself again, having to get Denzel Washington's film. Is it something to do with the army? No. Okay. I've not seen it. I know Denzel Washington.

Kev: 48:11
Okay, so maybe training day. Your other option is Million Dollar Baby. I've got nothing. Nothing at all on Million Dollar Baby. But you watch The Office? Yeah. Okay. Well, it's mentioned in The Office.

Rob: 48:24
So is a lot of things.

Kev: 48:25
Well, you have to go back and watch all how many seasons? Nine, ten seasons of The Office if you want any clues before next week. Or you could Google it, I suppose. As is always the that's always the Jeopardy.

Rob: 48:35
What is Google?

Kev: 48:37
Right, I got it. Let's go with that one. Well you want million dollar baby, not training death.

Rob: 48:42
I struggled to squeeze Tom Cruise into this film if I'm honest.

Kev: 48:45
Well we didn't he didn't get much mention uh apart from at the start when we said it's gonna be Tom Cruise. Yeah, I think it could have been anyone, but you were that's who you were.

Rob: 48:53
Yeah, limiting my thoughts. So if we go with what was it? Million dollar baby. Million dollar baby. Yeah, I'm gonna do a female lead this time.

Kev: 48:59
I mean that's slightly irritating because in advance I had already checked that I could get hold of training day and I haven't done the same million dollar baby.

Rob: 49:06
If it makes your life harder, Kev, I'm 100% sticky with that.

Kev: 49:08
Excellent. I had to sign up, incidentally, uh, for a free trial on Paramount Plus to watch the Minority Report this week. I got seven days. So I checked my spreadsheet. I I've probably got a couple of days to get it in there.

Rob: 49:23
I uh I checked my spreadsheet. I used to own Minority Report.

Kev: 49:26
Of course you did.

Rob: 49:27
I it was gifted to me, a steel book version of the Blu-ray. So I used to collect specifically steel editions of films.

Kev: 49:34
Of course you did, because because they were great investments rather than something to watch. So it was gifted to me. Remind me, did you make any money on these investments?

Rob: 49:43
They weren't investments, they were sold. That's different.

Kev: 49:46
Well, yeah, okay.

Rob: 49:47
So it was gifted to me by someone who, similar to you, was fascinated by the fact I hadn't watched a lot of films and it was his favourite film, so he bought him in and I never watched it. That really I've got an eBay listing of his selling gifts. I've not spoken to him in ten years.

Kev: 50:02
Since you've sold his prize. Okay. So he three, yeah, all right. Well anyway. Right, fine. So we're gonna have a go at Million Dollar Baby. Yep. Um, but we should now just quickly go over the quick recap of what Reservoir Dogs was actually about. You remember that last week Rob decided Reservoir Dogs would be a Disney film featuring extended scenes of gratuitous violence.

Rob: 50:26
I let you choose, and then you added details in, so I can't take all the blame. Credit. Um Credit is the word you'll be using as a director.

Kev: 50:35
Um I'm gonna stick with blame just for this. Possibly correctly. Right, Reservoir Dogs is a Quentin Tarantino film. Um now I happen to know you like one particular Quentin Tarantino film, though you may not even know that's Quentin Tarantino, which is Inglorious Bastards. Yes. Yeah. So I've seen that.

Rob: 50:51
Yeah, I've seen that about three times. I used to in the Steelbook.

Kev: 50:54
Of course you did. Okay, so Quentin Tarantino directs Reservoir Dogs. It's a film about a diamond heist gone badly wrong. We never see the diamond heist itself. Um, the film starts with uh a couple of characters uh driving away in a banged-up car. One of them's at the back, he's been shot, there's blood going everywhere. They're talking about, oh, what are we gonna do? I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, all this kind of stuff. They hole themselves up in a little warehouse, um, and gradually other characters come back. All of them are called Mr. Something, Mr. Colour. So Mr. Orange has been shot right at the start. Um, Mr. Mr. White, who you remember is your hero dog, yeah, is probably the main fact you remember that. Yeah, well, the main most developed uh character probably in Reservoir Dogs is Mr. White, played by Harvey Kaitel. Um you'll remember he puts his trust in the wrong place. We'll come back to it.

Rob: 51:44
Is Harvey Kaitel not in End Ubs?

Kev: 51:46
In End Ubs?

Rob: 51:47
I'm sure he's in End Ubs.

Kev: 51:48
I don't know anything about end ubs, I'm afraid. Maybe make that the with the Lisa.

Rob: 51:53
I'm sure he is.

Kev: 51:54
Well, if he is, it's probably not the same Harvey Kaitel.

Rob: 51:57
Probably not, no.

Kev: 51:58
Harvey Kaitel is a very distinguished actor. Okay. American, of course, so it doesn't sound like that. Um anyway, so there he uh Mr. Orange has got shot. Mr. White is trying to save him. They they hole up in this little um warehouse thing. Uh in comes Mr. Pink, Mr. Fucking Pink, if you remember him, played by Steve Bushamy, who's a great actor. He's the professional one, he's like, How did all this happen? Don't tell me your name, all that kind of stuff. They've worked out because of how quickly the police were there, it's like they were waiting for them to do it. So it's a setup, somebody's a someone's a rat. Um they throw around some accusations at each other for a little bit. Basically, that goes on for a while until Mr. Blonde arrives, played by Michael Madsen. Mr. Blonde's an absolute psycho. Um, he's kind of laughing at them about how panicked they are and things like that. It doesn't really matter to him that everybody ended up getting shot. He went mad in the Diamond Heist and started shooting the whole place up. Um they weren't very happy with that. Um, right up until the point that he says, Oh, I've got something in the boot you might want to see. And he goes out and opens the boot of his car. He's got a policeman in there, hasn't he? He's only got a policeman in the boot of his car. Uh so they drag him in to the warehouse, tie him up a bit, torture him.

Rob: 53:04
Tie him up a bit.

Kev: 53:05
Tie him up a bit, torture him a bit. Um the others leave, apart from Mr. Orange, who's bleeding out on the floor because they can't get him a doctor, of course, because if they take him to the hospital, then uh everybody's cover blown. Yeah, cover blown. Um Mr. Blonde uh starts listening to Stuck in the Middle With You from K Billy's Super Sounds of the 70s and covers him in petrol, cuts off his ear, and just as he's about to set him a light, Mr. Orange, bleeding out on the floor, shoots Mr. Blonde. Right. Because guess what? Mr. Orange is the fucking rat.

Rob: 53:38
Right.

Kev: 53:39
But Mr. White has spent well, Mr. White has spent the whole film basically saying it can't be Mr. Orange, Mr. Orange, this, he got shot. Don't I do that day, so you know all that kind of stuff. He's protecting Mr. Orange. Mr. Orange has shot Mr. Blonde. Because Mr. Blonde's a psycho. To be fair, Mr. Blonde definitely deserves it. Everybody else comes in, uh, including nice guy Eddie, uh, who's uh the son of the guy who masterminded the whole thing. Nice guy Eddie's like, why'd you shoot Mr. Blonde? That's not cool, man. He says he was gonna he was gonna kill the cop. And and nice guy, well, like this, and he just shoots the cop, so the cop dies anyway. Fair enough. Um Mr. White and uh nice guy Eddie and nice guy Eddie's dad called Joe turns up, he's the guy who organised the whole thing. Um not nice guy, you know, but Joe. They all end up pointing guns at each other and say, Don't shoot, uh put that gun down, don't you don't you point your gun at my dad. Don't you don't shoot off if I can shoot him?

Rob: 54:33
Is that where the meme comes from, where they're all pointing guns at each other?

Kev: 54:36
Very well, but that's a Spider-Man sort of thing. But but but it's a similar thing. It's a cartoon spider thing. The Reservoir Dogs did not feature Spider-Man. Um but yeah, it's a similar idea. Mr. White basically, all is good. He uh ends up shooting them, protecting Mr. Orange, only for Mr. Orange to tell him that he's a cop. And then at the end the police turn up and it fades to black as we hear a whole bunch of gunshots and basically everyone's dead. That sounds dreadful. Well, no, it's great.

Rob: 55:06
It would be loads better if they had real names. Why I'm assuming they're called Mr. Colour because they want to cover their tracks.

Kev: 55:13
Uh yeah, presumably they've got to stay uh anonymous something. Yeah. Otherwise everyone would know who everyone was and they would be a risk of telling each other off.

Rob: 55:20
Yeah, well, it didn't end very well for them, did it? Not at all.

Kev: 55:24
Anyway, so that is the plot of reservoir dogs. I preferred my actual dog version.

Rob: 55:28
No reservoirs involved. I know there wasn't in mine either, they were quarries, but no reservoir.

Kev: 55:33
Well, no dogs either.

Rob: 55:34
Yeah.

Kev: 55:36
That's uh curveball. Anyway, right, we'll see we'll see you next week for a million dollar baby. I'm looking forward to it. Take care. Bye bye.
