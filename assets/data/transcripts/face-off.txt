Kev: 00:00
Hello and welcome to the first episode of the No Context Cinema Club, a show where an almost unbelievably unqualified person rewrites film history by creating plots based only on titles and the true, though sometimes disingenuous, clues that I provide him about the real films. Each week we'll explore Rob's complete ignorance of film history, testing the limits of what is possible to have missed from pop culture during his 30-something years on this planet, and hopefully having some fun along the way. There are two fundamental rules. Firstly, he's not allowed to research or Google anything as we go, and secondly, once he's locked something in in his plot, there are no takebacks. Will Rob's alternative cuts be works of cinematic genius, or simply descend into the insane ramblings of a lunatic? Only time will tell. At the end of each episode, I'll score Rob's efforts in three areas coherence, entertainment factor, and originality. For our first episode, we'll be diving headlong into the 90s action classic, FaceOff. So Rob, would you like to introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about the origins of this podcast?

Rob: 00:54
Yes. So a while back you uh mentioned a film called FaceOff, which we're going to talk about today. Um and you were humoured by my initial thoughts about what the film was. Um obviously I was incorrect with my initial thoughts, and then you obviously wanted me to come onto a podcast with you so you could mock me generally about my film knowledge.

Kev: 01:15
Which is a very valuable and insightful idea for the world of podcasting. Pretty much, yeah. In our first section, which we'll be calling plot luck, Rob has nothing but the title to work with. So let's see what his initial guesswork tells us about the new director's cut of faceoff. So have you had any initial thoughts on what face off might be since you first pitched what you assumed it was?

Rob: 01:36
So I I obviously know that my original thought wasn't quite there. So I've I've been thinking about what face-off could be. I've got two thoughts about what it could be. Uh the first one, uh, which was my initial reaction, was based on my knowledge of your love for ice hockey. So when you mentioned face off, my initial thought was that it was an ice hockey-based film. You laughed quite a lot about that. So then my second thought was that it was some sort of film where a character loses their face, referencing uh the office, Dwight Shroots, has a face peeled off and then put onto his face at one point.

Kev: 02:09
I am familiar with the episode in which that happens. That I think is more of a reference to a film than a reference from the office. But we'll let that no, we'll let's explore that for a second. So Dwight takes the face off the Rosussi dummy, doesn't he? Yep. In the episode, and then says he always wonders how realistic it is to do that. I think that's probably referencing the silence of the lambs with Anthony Hopkins, but it's also possibly a reference to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I suppose, because there's a character called Leatherface in that who takes a face off. So either way, I mean I'm happy with that.

Rob: 02:40
Um I'm referencing a TV show, which is referencing a film which I'm unaware of.

Kev: 02:45
That is brilliant, I would say a fair, fair summary of the situation, yes. Yep. Okay, right. So which of those avenues shall we exploit? To be honest, because it was your first thought, I think even though we subsequently know it's not correct, I'd quite like to follow the ice hockey theme if you were happy, but we can we can go with the take taking a face off a person if you prefer.

Rob: 03:06
I I feel like I've fleshed out the ice hockey film more in my mind, and obviously it was only an immediate reaction. And I I reckon I reckon there's a film there that we could talk about, even if it doesn't exist.

Kev: 03:16
Okay, well, it doesn't exist. Um let's do this. Okay, so the film in in which we're working on here is going to be an ice hockey-based film. Have you got any thoughts about the plot other than it's about ice hockey?

Rob: 03:29
Well, all films that are about sport have a very similar story arc, and that is that there is some sort of crisis, whether it's a a school or a club in crisis or an individual in crisis, and then it's basically just redemption arc from there. So I think overall it's going to be a redemption story, but it's a redemption story for an individual.

Kev: 03:50
Okay. Uh have you got any thoughts on the individual, the protagonist of this particular story?

Rob: 03:56
Yep, I don't know the actor's name. Oh, yeah, okay. So what we will find over the course of this podcast is that I also don't know many many actors and what they're in. I've got a weird word association when it comes to film and actors that I just think of random things and then or I associate them with random things, and that's what I'll refer to. So the actor, I've got I've got a lead actor for the film. I don't know his name, so you're gonna have to help me with that. I'll try. He is the guy that is in Jurassic Park with is the bigger guy that wears a yellow jacket in the rain.

Kev: 04:28
Oh, out in the rain, okay. Yeah, he's the guy that uh ends up getting eaten on the toilet. Does he? He I think he does. I mean, I haven't seen Jurassic Park for a while, but I'm fairly sure. So the guy, I know who you're talking about. Um, and he is a guy, he was in Seinfeld, I think, and a comedy called Third Rock from the Sun as Officer Don. But anyway, go on. He's he's also in Cool Runnings. He okay, he's not also in Cool Runnings.

Rob: 04:52
He is, is is the coach in Cool Runnings?

Kev: 04:54
Uh that's John Candy, who is another fat guy. Ah, right. Okay.

Rob: 04:59
So I've mixed up my uh my Hollywood fat guys.

Kev: 05:03
I I think you might have. Okay, right, but so John so John Candy in Cool Runnings, which is a sport film which features a redemption arc for the main character. I can see where this has uh sort of crept into your consciousness because yeah, John Candy in that film in Cool Runnings is a disgraced Bob Slay coach who cheated when he himself was in the Winter Olympics.

Rob: 05:26
Right. So something that we should worry about is that my ice hockey film is pretty much that.

Kev: 05:31
Well, I mean, there's similar there's ice, uh there's a redemption. There's not even ice for the character. But I but I you know I think we can work with this. I mean, in face off, you want John you want either John Candy or offers a don from Third Rock from the Sun who also uh gets wears a big yellow jacket in the rain in Jackson.

Rob: 05:48
I'm sure I'm sure the guy in uh in Colour Runnings wears a yellow jacket. I know he wears a big duffel.

Kev: 05:56
In okay. Have you watched Home Alone recently, Rob? Yep, love Home Alone. Okay. I think John Candy wears a yellow jacket in his short cameo appearance in Home Alone when he is, was he, uh I can't remember the name of it, but he goes, Polka, polka, polka. He's the polka singer. The back of the van. I think they all wear yellow jackets, don't they? Um his polka outfit who was trying to get back to Milwaukee or something like that.

Rob: 06:19
Is the guy in the back of the van the guy from Jurassic Park or Cool Runnings?

Kev: 06:24
Cool Runnings. That's John Candy in both.

Rob: 06:26
So you want him.

Kev: 06:27
He is my main man. Sorry, guy from Third Rock from the Sun, and I think Seinfeld, and I don't know your name, I'm afraid, but John Candy has just beaten you to it in the final casting to be the protagonist of Rob's new film Face Off. But don't worry, John Candy will be very used to the role because he's played it already in Cool Runnings by the sound of it. Although he was much more alive when that was made than he is currently.

Rob: 06:47
Immediate casting issues. Yeah, yes. What I will say is I I was thinking coming into this that my film knowledge was below average, but my TV knowledge was better than average. Okay. So my um my references are gonna be poor at this point, I think.

Kev: 07:05
Well, I mean let's explore. So we've got John Candy playing the role of what?

Rob: 07:10
Uh obviously based in America.

Kev: 07:12
Of course, if it's well, or Canada maybe if it's I mean, John Candy was Canadian, I believe. So you know, you could be Canadian. No, America. We're going to Hollywood, yeah.

Rob: 07:19
We're going, yeah, we're going to the big screen, so we're at Hollywood, why not? He's some sort of teacher. Okay. I don't know if he's lower school or middle school. I don't know what they call lower school over in the States.

Kev: 07:29
I don't know. Elementary, is it? Elementary, but they're probably too young to be doing much ice hockey stuff with a redemption arc.

Rob: 07:36
He is a coach at a middle school ice hockey team. And here's the twist: he used to be big time.

Kev: 07:46
Did he? He used to be big time. He used to be big time. Did he skate in the Olympics? Like he did in Garchomp.

Rob: 07:52
I'm assuming that's a reference to Gorin's. No, he didn't used to. He was on the verge of becoming um uh a National Hockey League coach.

Kev: 08:02
Was he? Yep. So he was on the on the cusp of NHL stardom. As a coach, not as a player.

Rob: 08:07
Uh yeah, as a coach, he's a big guy. He's not gonna be an amazing hockey player.

Kev: 08:11
Okay, well he could have been a goon. You know, he could have been a guy on skates who just goes out to pummel people.

Rob: 08:15
Yeah, I like I like that. No, no, he's not that. He's he was on the verge of becoming a successful NHL coach.

Kev: 08:22
Okay, right, and now he finds himself in high school or middle school, whatever you said.

Rob: 08:27
Yeah, yeah, but not in a school that's in Canada. I don't want that. I don't want him in a cold state. Okay, he is in a warm state. He's in I want to say Florida. Okay, yeah, that's maybe wearing a nice uh nice sort of uh um palm tree shirt to the games. Okay, so he's he's wearing his sort of flamboyant some somewhere not known for the hockey. Okay, well, I mean the Florida Panthers won the Stanley Cup very recently. So this is the problem that your knowledge of hockey is better than mine as well, so it's gonna follow me here. So somewhere where it's got him in New Mexico. Perfect.

Kev: 09:02
Lovely. He's in New Mexico.

Rob: 09:04
Is there a desert in New Mexico or that's the case?

Kev: 09:05
I think it's basically a giant desert, really. I think New Mexico. It's where Breaking Bad was set, if you've ever heard of that.

Rob: 09:10
I've heard of it, I've watched some of it. Again, I thought my TV knowledge was better than my knowledge, but maybe I'm incorrect on that one. It is somewhere I I feel a bit deserty, a bit Arizona, maybe somewhere around Phoenix.

Kev: 09:23
Alright, we're going for Phoenix. I think they just lost their hockey team. Uh they got re-uh, don't forget, re-franchised somewhere. I went to Utah, I think, another desert, but this is middle school. Okay, yeah, that's true.

Rob: 09:33
This isn't Hockey League, this is middle school.

Kev: 09:36
Okay, but the youngsters could be devastated that their NHL team, their local NHL team have just left, and that was their pathway to success.

Rob: 09:43
This is based in the same year that Space Jam was I've no idea what it was when there was.

Kev: 09:49
I don't know. I mean the Space Jam feels like a late, no, maybe a mid-90s film to me.

Rob: 09:54
Maybe the reason being is Space Jam. I remember in the serial you used to get the little toys and the Space Jam toys. Right. There's gonna be toys for this film. There's gonna be toys in the series and some merchandise. Little hockey pucks.

Kev: 10:06
Little pucks with the team, whatever they're gonna be. Yeah, the New Mexico. Yeah, we'll probably focus on the team next rather than the freebies that are given out. Okay, right. So he's coaching in New Mexico. Yep. Okay, what has I mean, what has been this terrible thing that he needs redemption from?

Rob: 10:22
Not sure yet. Okay, he's definitely done something which has shamed himself, and he's essentially on the run in hiding, and he's not been able to take his his amazing job up at the NHL, and he's he's had to go and the only job he can get is uh a really down on its look middle school hockey team in Arizona. Okay, a ragtag bunch of misfits. Yeah, nobody wants to play hockey, they're all they're all out enjoying the the desert, I suppose. Doing whatever you do in the desert, chasing cactuses or something.

Kev: 10:50
But famously difficult to catch.

Rob: 10:54
He doesn't want to be there, and the hockey team. I've got a vague reference of something I've seen on TikTok where a basketball coach goes and he causes a bit of trouble at the school he goes to, it's a high-flying basketball team, and he he comes and messes things up by requiring certain grade point averages and stuff like that. He's a little bit like that.

Kev: 11:13
That is Coach Carter. I think you're probably referencing there with Samuel L. Jackson as as the as the main coach who won't accept any ill discipline from his from his team.

Rob: 11:23
Is Samuel L. Jackson bold in the film?

Kev: 11:26
He I believe Samuel L. Jackson is bold in every film and life. In that case, it might be okay. Right, so what was what was his crime? Was there a crime?

Rob: 11:39
Yeah, fraud, obviously.

Kev: 11:40
Fraud, okay.

Rob: 11:42
Defrauded the hockey team. Um I don't know, he was dodging his taxes. Dodging his taxes, okay. No, probably shouldn't on the first episode alienate all Americans. No. Um, he is dodging some sort of taxes or fraud, um, and he's been dragged into a he's he's a nice guy, but he has been found to be guilty for this.

Kev: 12:04
Okay, and now he finds himself down on his luck in the middle of the desert, trying to coach a ragtag bunch of misfits who have no interest in playing ice hockey. That's what we're going with.

Rob: 12:12
Yep.

Kev: 12:12
In our next section called The Plot Thickens, I'll be feeding Rob some more information about the real film face-off, um, which he's going to be forced to include within his own already slightly derivative plot. So here we go. The first thing I've got for you, Rob, is that in the real film face-off, the hero does assume a new identity.

Rob: 12:33
Right, okay. So my main character who is played by John Candy. By John Candy. Uh it's a coincidence that because he's called John in the film as well.

Kev: 12:44
That's helpful. That's what I'm saying.

Rob: 12:44
He's called John in the film now, but he wasn't when the film first started.

Kev: 12:48
So because he's got to assume a new identity. Correct.

Rob: 12:51
So um what I didn't say in the first section was that actually that it's quite a bit of court case he's going through, and as part of that, he's under a bit of pressure. So part of his move to uh Phoenix, Arizona, um is part of the witness protection programme, actually. So he's taken up a totally new life. So he's obviously working through his skill sets that he's got, but um, he has left his whole life behind and he's now called John.

Kev: 13:15
Now called John. Right, we don't know what he was called before. That's okay, we don't need to worry about that. He's in witness protection. Why would we know what he was called before? Right. Uh can I just clarify, we're in Phoenix, Arizona, aren't we? I said New Mexico earlier. You weren't happy with that. No, we moved him to Phoenix, Arizona, that's all good.

Rob: 13:30
I I know more about Phoenix because I once flew out of there, so that feels like it should be that, and it's definitely hot.

Kev: 13:36
It is very hot in Phoenix, Arizona. Okay, perfect. So John is now in Phoenix, Arizona. He's under witness protection for some sort of financial fraud-based activities in his previous life.

Rob: 13:51
Something to do with the NHL.

Kev: 13:54
Something to do, oh okay, right. So it's a potentially a big story, is it?

Rob: 13:58
Yeah, so do you remember back in the 90s when Premier League managers were accused of tapping up players? Oh, yes, of course. He was doing that, but with sponsors and he was taking kickbacks. He was he was found guilty of taking kickbacks, but there was a lot of money involved, and people went missing. It got a little bit a little bit dirty, a little bit nasty, and that's when he was uh relocated. Hang about. Can you guys can you guilty? Why is he in witness protection? Can you be guilty of the city? Why is he in witness protection then? If he's already been found guilty of this crime? Sorry, there's an ongoing trial. Sorry, there's an ongoing trial. He's presumed guilty. You misspoke. Misspoke, yeah. Like he probably did in court, I imagine. He's a nervous guy. Um he is under a trial and there's risk to his life, and for that reason he's in witness protection while under suspicion.

Kev: 14:46
Well, under suspicion, so maybe he's done it, maybe he hasn't. Yeah, but we all know he's guilty. Okay, we know he's alright, fine. It's it's clear in his arc that he has to so far, yeah. Okay, alright. So that explains why uh the hero gets a new identity. That's good. Um I've got a quote from uh face off that I picked up when I rewatched it last week for this. Um in this he actually says when all else fails, fresh tactics.

Rob: 15:16
Perfect. And this fits right into the rest of the film. Because what we've not talked about is actually his day-to-day job in Phoenix or or what he does on a day-to-day basis. He's obviously gone to this middle school and he's started to coach them ice hockey. They're not very keen on it, obviously, they're in the middle of a desert, they don't have an ice hockey rink, he has to do fundraisers. I'm I'm thinking this too as I'm talking about. They don't have a ring, he has to do fundraisers. How have they given him a job? Why have they taken him on as a coach? They're a high school who've just got funding for an ice hockey team, and he has to go and help raise more funds to build a rink and start the program kit and all that. So he has to get the kids on board, he has to convince the school they need to go bigger and better, the parents can't be bothered. Wow. That's where his starting point was. But he's actually a really good coach.

Kev: 16:10
Okay, right. So he is a genuinely good coach.

Rob: 16:12
Yeah, he's a genuinely good coach, which is why he was targeted targeted by the blinking thieves earlier.

Kev: 16:18
So for the benefit of the listeners, uh Rob just sort of shook his fist in a in a in a very dramatic way that sadly was will never be caught on the podcast itself.

Rob: 16:29
But he he's obviously very clued up and he gets the team playing quite well. Um and he's got a bit of a love interest that's that he meets one of the teachers maybe there. Okay. Um, and you can see there's a bit of a relationship blossoming between the two. Um he's bringing these.

Kev: 16:44
He's not gonna let that he's not gonna let her down, is he?

Rob: 16:47
Well, he's a nice guy, Kevin. He's doing really well. He's he's brought the community together. You they've gone from having nothing to that they can't wait for Thursday night when they play ice hockey.

Kev: 16:58
Okay, but I sort of feel like in these sorts of films, and you don't have to go with this because it's your movie, in these sorts of films, there's often a point where he has to, I don't know, balance the interests of the team or himself versus the the burgeoning love interest.

Rob: 17:14
Oh yeah, there's because she's only free on Thursday nights.

Kev: 17:18
Okay. Did I imagine she she worked? But but he is starting the programme, so arguably he could just move the tank.

Rob: 17:24
There's availability of the other teams and whatever, and it's Thursday night league hockey night. Of course.

Kev: 17:29
And obviously she And it's the only it's the only day that the as yet unbuilt rink is free.

Rob: 17:34
Yeah, it's very, very, very busy. Uh, but also uh her son is on the hockey team. Oh damn, he is not very good. Oh, he he was first round of like the the call he was dropped.

Kev: 17:48
Right, well we're we're fleshing out the story quite nicely. Yeah, I would like you to explain why the movie starts with a very lengthy sort of 15-minute runway chase and shootout, if you could.

Rob: 18:01
Yeah, obviously. It's quite the curved part.

Kev: 18:08
A 15-minute review. Yeah, it's it's a it lasts about 15 minutes. I mean, probably the runway part is about 10 minutes and then there's five minutes.

Rob: 18:15
You you need to rewatch the film, Kev, because I that doesn't happen in this version of FaceOff. That's fine. I have it doesn't happen in this version. It does happen in this version of FaceOff, actually. I don't know if you've seen the um opening to Toy Story 2, I believe.

Kev: 18:31
That's the one with the prospector guy, the smelly prospector guy train.

Rob: 18:36
Maybe so the opening scene of FaceOff, I nearly forgot the name of the screen. Is a very dramatic reenactment of a plane landing and a gunfight around the plane, but it's actually John and his love interest son playing with his toys. So we kind of meet them midway.

Kev: 19:01
I now I remember the the story or the part of Toy Story 2 that you're referencing now. It might be Toy Story 2, it might be Toy Story 3. Um if you need any more film, just let me know. It all goes back there in there. That's right, it's quite an elaborate opening sequence, and then it turns out it's just um Andy or something playing with his toys. Right. So the next the next part of information I've got for you um is going to involve a relatively lengthy impression. And I'd just like to point out now that I'm doing an impression as a stylistic or kind of artistic choice, and it's in no way related to uh a basic lack of understanding of intellectual property law.

Rob: 19:35
Um I've genuinely never been this excited.

Kev: 19:38
I didn't know we were doing impression. Well, I mean, get ready. Um I would like to point out so in actuality, and I I'm not gonna say too much about the actual film of Face Off, but it is possibly one of the most outrageously overacted movies that I have ever seen. You might have seen The Mask, surely you've seen the mask with Jim Carrey. Yeah. Okay. In that, he's very deliberately overacting, yeah? Yeah. So in this, they're just acting like that. Uh but anyway, so I've got a quote for you, and I think I think we were able to easily and seamlessly fit in this in, but here we go.

Kev: 20:10
You're asking me to break the law, risk my neck, and you're asking me to put in the dark all the people that love me and trust me. I'll do it. Uh, where does that fit into the film? Firstly, I am flawed by that act, which is great.

Kev: 20:29
Well, thank you.

Rob: 20:30
I mean, I th I think this is pretty obvious where it fits into the film. It's um it obviously calls back to the initial court case that's going on, and obviously we know he's got a new love interest, but he has left loved ones behind, not necessarily a partner, but he has left friends and family and and ex-colleagues, and they're obviously embroiled in some of their fraudulent issues that he's facing um that cost him his job in the NHL.

Kev: 20:57
Yeah, okay. Well, I mean, and once again, I'm just gonna dive back to the original face-off because this really stood out for me, that quote, um, just with a pure, complete level of selfishness, where he only talks about all the people that love me and trust me, and he doesn't make any reference to his own feelings about them whatsoever. It's all about oh, you're asking me to do this to the people who love me. Um, not to the people he loves, but the people who love him. So he's I think he's got a slightly selfish side. Um, how do we square that circle?

Rob: 21:23
I I think your painting, John, is quite a one-dimensional character there. I think actually the move, the big the move to the big city, to the movement to Phoenix, has actually brought out a softer side, and he's actually more of a community man. So he's obviously learnt his lesson from uh his his past trials, I'd imagine.

Kev: 21:40
Okay, all right. Well, I mean it it fits. So we've managed to put in some genuine details from FaceOp into your film almost seamlessly. Um, there have there there are a couple more that we could throw in there if you like. Would you like to explain, for example, why at one point he then says, Dress up like Halloween, and ghouls will try to get. Your pants. You got everything for that.

Rob: 22:07
That is left field. When you started talking about dress up for Halloween, I was I was obviously going to refer back to some of the fundraising the school did, but uh Ghoul's getting in his pants is a bit of a left field um introduction. I suppose he's he's obviously he's obviously talking to his new love interest. Of course, of course. He's uh he's trying to tell her the problems he's going through, but it is in the the the the law, the the the law issues he's got the legal issues he's got. So it's a metaphor. He's trying to tell her that how much he's struggling without telling her he's in witness protection. And that is his way of of expressing his so is he currently dressing up like Halloween?

Kev: 22:52
He's always dressing because he's having in the film, he's just constantly dressed up as a zombie in scene one later, he comes back and like a decapitated head. No, it's just it's just obviously the the uh is his witness protection bit him dressed up like Halloween.

Rob: 23:09
Absolutely, I like it.

Kev: 23:10
So you're getting into this now, and the ghouls that are trying to get in in his pack.

Rob: 23:15
Oh, the lawyers who are coming after him in his career. He's he is a yeah, you would feel he's a deep character.

Kev: 23:21
He is a deep character. He's very deep, John Candy, in this film. Probably the deepest role that John Candy would ever have played.

Rob: 23:28
I only know Home Alone and Jurassic Park, so I agree.

Kev: 23:30
And cool runnings.

Rob: 23:31
Cool runnings and not Jurassic Park, as I found out.

Kev: 23:35
Okay, alright. So that works. One more then. And I think this will be easy. He does spend a spell of face-off in a maximum security prison. Does he? He does. Well, John Candy doesn't think he's not in it, but but maximum security.

Rob: 23:54
What do you have to do to go to maximum security?

Kev: 23:57
It's probably some sort of uh unspecified financial fraud in the NHL, I think.

Rob: 24:02
Witness protection worthy. Um so so I I've harked back to him, the opening scene of him being on playing with his uh playing with the plane and on the runway. Well, that's where we actually start the film, but we do have flashbacks to his previous time and part of his struggles and part of the depth of John as a character is that all the way through he's got this real positive surge of energy coming from the middle school and his new love interest, and everything that's going well in his life.

Kev: 24:30
It's really working out. He's turned a corner.

Rob: 24:32
It's really working out. He's found his calling. Absolutely, you'd say so. Although he still he still harks back to his days of of potential glory and getting to the big time.

Kev: 24:42
So he still harbours ambitions to return to the NHL.

Rob: 24:44
Absolutely, but he can never do that again because of his situation. We do get flashbacks uh when he's really struggling, and I think he's probably got an underlying drink problem. Of course he does. And when he's when he's had a bit too many, uh a few too many, uh, these callbacks to his previous uh his previous life, and once he was arrested for his fraud, he was obviously taken to prison. And and you as a you as a viewer, you're watching it thinking, you just want him to get better, uh his mental health, so we can we can really make the most of his new life down in Phoenix.

Kev: 25:15
Okay, well, I mean I mean I think that's that you know all fits. It's a beautiful film we're constructing here. I don't think it's much like the original, um, but that's okay. I'm not going to ask you to shoehorn in a chemical weapon that threatens LA. Because although we're in the right sort of part of the USA for it, I feel like that might be a step too far. Um, I would like to explore why you think this film would be called face off. I know that I get there's the ice hockey bit, but presumably there's something a bit deeper as to why it's called face-off. Um it sounds like maybe there isn't much. Um I mean, is the court case unresolved? Yes, it's ongoing. So is is the face-off actually a legal face-off as well?

Rob: 26:03
Um I I actually just prefer the hockey. So hockey starting a new life, start of a new game. Okay.

Kev: 26:13
Well then so what I suppose really the next question is how does this film end? Like you said. Like what what are we building to? Because generally speaking, a story has has some form of resolution, whether or not it's happy, that you know, that's that's kind of by the way, and you're the uh you're the director here. So what are we building towards?

Rob: 26:31
And and this film is heartbreaking. Oh, is it it's heartbreaking because we've talked about the success he's having all the way through his new life in Phoenix. And we know there's an ongoing court case, and that court case actually finds him innocent.

Kev: 26:48
So he didn't he didn't actually he didn't do any of the stuff.

Rob: 26:53
And this is the big moral dilemma on the last on the last scene, the last few scenes is his mini his team's hockey. Oh no, they haven't reached a final. I promise they've reached a final. But it's on the same day as the big trial. Oh, of course. And he has got to choose does he want to continue with his new life, little league hockey team, yeah, his new love interest, or does he want to go back and clear his name? Right. His one chance to do that. One chance, one shot, and potentially get back in the big time in NHL.

Kev: 27:29
Wow, that's that's quite the dilemma. Um, what's what's he gonna do? Oh, that's another reason it's called face-off, then, surely. Obviously, but you know, it's it's this, you know, real head-to-head dilemma.

Rob: 27:43
He is facing off against his past.

Kev: 27:45
He is facing off against his past quite literally. Right now, I understand where you've been coming from all along, Director Rob.

Rob: 27:52
And the twist that nobody saw coming is that he goes back for the court case, he's found him to the city. Good. That time, no bloody pitch. His selfish undertones uh come through, right?

Kev: 28:06
Well, I mean, we did today, right? Well, I mean, you know, that that quote about all of his loved ones, or sorry, all the ones who love him. Exactly.

Rob: 28:12
He's not worried about anyone else.

Kev: 28:14
It's all about John.

Rob: 28:16
All about John, and he ditches them, he leaves into the final. They're going to lose, by the way. Good. The community is heartbroken. He goes back to the big trial. Obviously, now everyone else who was putting him at risk is no longer involved and he's found. So they go down. Yeah, they go down, so he doesn't need to be in witness protection anymore. He's found totally innocent. And never goes back to never goes back to innocent. Never goes back to Phoenix.

Kev: 28:38
Brutal.

Rob: 28:39
Totally forgets. The love interest. Yeah, can't even remember a name.

Kev: 28:43
The kid who's who he was playing with a plain runway chase action thing right at the start. Yeah, we don't know what happens to him.

Rob: 28:49
We do just no further reference to Phoenix in the whole film.

Kev: 28:52
Savage.

Rob: 28:53
Does does he Okay? He just doesn't care. He doesn't care. And actually, we want him to get better, we want his mental health to get better, we want him to stop drinking, and he does care if his mental health is loads better, he stops drinking. He leaves a trail of destruction across the whole of Arizona, but he gets back to his position to further his career and be a big time hockey coach.

Kev: 29:16
And and are we as the audience supposed to feel a particular way about that, or is that that really is oh is really the cut through the crux of it is the rugged thing.

Rob: 29:26
The rug has been pulled from under your feet. You've gone from wanting him to be a success, wanting the best room, and really thinking that he's going to make the most of it with Phoenix to not caring what happens to him. And it is about the cutthroat reality of being a top elite sports coach in the US.

Kev: 29:44
That was what it was all about, really.

Rob: 29:45
That's what it's all about, and a little bit about Phoenix.

Kev: 29:49
And some children are getting heartbroken along the way. Well, okay. Um, well, I think we've sort of reached the the the kind of the point where where we've effectively lost the plot.

Rob: 30:00
Uh tell me that's not like every sports film in Hollywood you've ever seen.

Kev: 30:05
Well, it's it's quite derivative in a number of areas, but I feel like the ending, I mean, he's gone and he's cleared his name and he's left the team. He doesn't reappear at the 11th hour for kind of a in the final period he turns up and they're all looking his way and they're pleased or anything like that. Nope. They maybe they keep looking for him, and we're expecting as an audience, we're expecting him to walk in the tunnel, but instead he's just gone to the bar.

Rob: 30:29
No, I don't know. There's I like that, and then actually he's is just at an NHL game. Yeah, just sitting he's been shmoozed by the CEO of some uh hockey team and he's gonna get his job back. Nice, hot dog on a beer, sat back. And that the only time the people from Phoenix ever see him again is on the TV.

Kev: 30:47
Wow, brutal.

Kev: 30:48
Yeah. So, well, as I said, derivative in many ways, but I think the ending probably wouldn't be a classic sort of happy ending there. But I quite like the way you've reimagined face off. I suppose now it comes down to the scoring, which starts with this. We did talk about the three particular areas where we'd be scoring, and they were coherence. I mean, it it does actually plausibly fit together quite nicely.

Rob: 31:14
There is no plot holes. Name one plot hole.

Kev: 31:17
Name one plot hole. I mean, the the the ghouls in your pants Halloween bit is a bit tenuous. I'm really not sure about the made-up plain start because that that that feels like it belongs in a story where actually he does end up having some value or meaning for the child.

Rob: 31:36
Or a reference to the ghouls in his past.

Kev: 31:38
Yeah, I can I get that. He just misread the script.

Rob: 31:42
He just misread the script.

Kev: 31:44
It was nothing to do with ghouls trying to get into your pants. It was the ghouls trying to get into your past.

Rob: 31:49
Thank you.

Kev: 31:50
There we go. That clarifies that. Well, in which case the coherence score can shoot right up. Um I I think you did a very good job actually of shoehorning in a whole bunch of different things. I did pick some quite friendly elements.

Rob: 32:00
15-minute plane battle.

Kev: 32:02
Yeah, well, you know. But also, that's why I feel that it lacks a bit of coherence because I just don't see that they would have had a 15-minute section of that in the film if it was really such a trivial part. So I'm going to score you six for coherence. Out of what? Uh 10. Everything's going to be arbitrary out of. I don't know what I'm going to no, I'm going to make it seven. I'll give you seven for coherence on it. Because actually, there was there was a there was a redemption arc. It didn't end quite how I expected. Um, but that's good. Entertainment factor. It depends on how good the action scene is at the start, to be honest. Um I think uh Rubbish, okay. Well, you haven't really solved it. Um what about the the sort of it is it an emotional tugs at the heartstrings in the in the main element of it? I can see that it would be quite uh emotionally engaging watching his redemption arc.

Rob: 32:47
I think you're underestimating the fun that could be have that could be had fundraising for a new hockey rink and the I think that would be a very dry butt mini montage uh fundraising fundraising and selling cookies from the back of uh schoolyards and stuff like that.

Kev: 33:05
Okay, I I would have thought maybe the the montages would maybe be more ice hockey based and about no, there's there's actually very little of hockey than I didn't really see any of the game.

Rob: 33:14
Yeah, they don't I'm I'm not even sure they raise the funds for a rink.

Kev: 33:19
How do they make it to the final? Let's not worry about how they make it to the final because that's we're just gonna lose coherence if we if we do that. Entertainment factors. You have lowered that massively by focusing on the sponsorship angle. So, entertainment factor, I'm going with five. And you're and you're lucky to get five, frankly. Um, originality.

Rob: 33:38
Oh, can I score this? Go on, because I've watched very few films, and this is. And all of them are referenced in this one. All of them are referenced in this one, and it is a solid three. There is nothing in there that hasn't happened in Hollywood before.

Kev: 33:52
Well, no, but I mean we're we're not gonna hold you to that sort of start. You know, I don't think you're gonna have to be any any sort of Guillermo del Toro. Not that you know that doesn't matter. Okay, well, I would I'll I'll give you four for original just because the curveball at the end where he never goes back. You we're expecting, you know, if it follows the standard tropes of a kind of sports coach little league kind of thing, he goes back and they win the game somehow, or at least he goes back and consoles them and they all learn a lesson, but instead he just cuts them off. Um which is brutal, but I but quite original. Um so let's let's hit that for a five. A five? Yeah, five. What's in total? Uh I've already forgotten what the other numbers were. Brilliant. Adherence, I think maybe seven entertainment five and originality five. So you've got seventeen. I say we're for half marks. That is 17 out of 30. A high bar. It is well, it's it's a generous bar. We'll call it a generous bar. For next week, it's it's gonna get we're doing this again. Uh well, maybe how many films do you know about? I know about quite a few. The real question is how many films could I find that you don't know enough about, I suppose. A lot. Um the the next one, actually, on my mind, and I don't know how much you know about this film, is a film called Goodwill Hunting. Any any sort of knowledge of that?

Rob: 35:03
I've got no knowledge.

Kev: 35:04
Okay, perfect. So that's what I've got an initial reaction. Oh. Would you care to share any of that? Do you want to know my initial reaction to that? Or should we save that? We'll save that for next time. We'll save that for next time, otherwise people will think it's all scripted and we wouldn't want that, would we? Um at least that's what it says in the script here. Right, okay, so I think we've we've covered face off um in the no context cinema club, and I I really quite enjoyed it. So 17 out of 30, not a bad start to your directorial career.

Rob: 35:31
I mean, that is what top 50 on IMDB must be.

Kev: 35:35
You know about IMDb, do you?

Rob: 35:36
Yeah, I googled it before.

Kev: 35:39
Okay, excellent. Love that. Okay, right. So we will uh we'll call we'll call an end to face off then.

Rob: 35:47
Okay.

Kev: 35:47
Um, and thank you very much. We'll see you next time. See you later.

Rob: 35:52
So, Kev. Now, we've just spent the last half an hour or so talking about my lack of knowledge about films. But I I actually think my lack of knowledge about films is just is just because I've just not got any interest in films as such. Okay. So I think it's just a normal lack of knowledge. It's not special. I don't know.

Kev: 36:10
I would argue it's it's a gap in pretty pretty mainstream pop culture.

Rob: 36:17
I disagree. I I don't think many people know about FaceOff.

Kev: 36:21
I I well, okay. We'll maybe we'll find that out.

Rob: 36:24
So so anyway, I I think my lack of knowledge will be subsequent to your lack of knowledge in in some pretty pop culture things. Okay, alright. So I I've begged you for a section at the end of the podcast to try and I don't know exactly what the section is going to be. And it's gonna be unscripted. Okay, well, good. Yeah, good. And it's gonna be different probably every time we do it. Okay. But I've got a little quiz for you about something which I think is incredibly popular, which I don't think you'll know about. Okay, all right. And that's Doctor Who. Uh okay then, yes, you're correct. So I've got three questions which I think have entered the public consciousness in the last two decades.

Kev: 37:05
Okay, so 20 years of Doctor Who distilled to three questions.

Rob: 37:08
I think Doctor Who rebooted in 2007. Not sure. A lot of people will probably disagree with that.

Kev: 37:14
It might have been a bit earlier than that. Was it Christopher Eccleston playing the doctor? I'm worried that you know that.

Rob: 37:21
He is not one of my questions. Okay, well, good, good, good. But I reckon over the last two decades or so, these three things have entered public consciousness. Okay. And I want I want to basically prove to you that you've got as much of a gap with TV shows as I do with films. Alright. Just in three questions, I'm not gonna make you write a whole plot. So, question one, and this is multiple choice. Oh, okay. Well, do I do I have to have the options? I will give you the options. Okay, alright. Um, what is the name of the doctor's time machine? You don't have to have the options. That's the TARDIS. Oh, worrying. So that no is it you would think I would not know that. They get more difficult. I knew you'd know that.

Kev: 38:01
Good, of course. It's an easy warm up. What were your options that you'd written for that?

Rob: 38:04
Don't worry about that. TARDIS, TADAS, and TADAS. Okay, um, so that's question one. So you have a base. Do you know what TANDIS stands for? Of course I do. Time and relative dimensions. Oh, dimensions in space, is it?

Kev: 38:21
Alright, there we go. So that's Are you worried now? I'm a little bit worried.

Rob: 38:26
We got close.

Kev: 38:26
Five out of six don't matter.

Rob: 38:27
I'm glad I'm glad that um question two is a little bit more difficult. So in Matt Smith's first episode of The Doctor, what bizarre food combination is he craving during his regeneration? I've got I've got multiple choices.

Kev: 38:40
Yeah, I'm gonna need that.

Rob: 38:41
So is it apple pie and gravy? Oh fish fingers and custard, or pancakes and tomato soup.

Kev: 38:47
Okay, that is this is gonna be pure guesswork, but it's a British film. Well the officers. I'm sorry, a British TV series, you're right, yeah.

Rob: 38:54
Apple pie and gravy, fish fingers and custard, or pancakes with tomato soup.

Kev: 38:60
Well, if it's a little curve ball thrown in for the American audience, because I think I'm right in saying that they talk about biscuits and gravy or gravy and biscuits, and that's like an apple thing with not gravy with something else, but that's what Americans call it. So I'm gonna take that. And you are very wrong.

Rob: 39:17
Ah crap. Which is great for me because it proves my point.

Kev: 39:21
Well, it That's a bit niche, but alright.

Rob: 39:23
It's not so it's fish, fingers, and custard.

Kev: 39:25
Right, and and how has that entered the collective conversation? How many people if if I went up to them in the street and said uh, what did Matt Smith crave when in his first episode regenerating as Doctor Who?

Rob: 39:37
How many people, if you walked to talk to them on the street and asked them about face-off, would be able to quote or or reference it?

Kev: 39:43
I think way more than we would see on the street. This is a good conjecture, isn't it?

Rob: 39:47
Yeah. So so that is if you go on Etsy, by the way, and search Doctor Who, you can get Fish, Fingers, and Custard on everything. Oh, okay, alright. So it's a thing. It's not just me. Fish, fingers, and custard. It's quite a big thing. So question three, and this is the last one, it's multiple choice again. So this is around the highest rated episode on of Doctor Who according to IMDB users. Call back to before. This is when I had to Google IMDb. That's why you're on IMDb, then. So um the Doctor, this is a question about the highest rated episode. So the doctor sends a cryptic message back through time to help his friends survive an encounter with the weeping angels. What is his key instruction? Is it stay in the light? Is it avoid mirrors, or is it don't blink?

Kev: 40:35
Or weeping angels. Stay in the light. I can believe that would work. Avoid mirrors. Avoid mirrors. And the third one's blink. Don't blink. Weeping angels. I will go with stay in the light, please.

Rob: 40:56
And again, you're wrong. This is great news for me. Terrible. So I got 17 out of 30, which was way over 50%, and you've got one out of three, which is under 50%. So I think it's kind of proved my point that my knowledge isn't as bad as potentially you think it is.

Kev: 41:13
Well, I think that our lengthy exploration of face off suggests otherwise. But we can find out next time when by the sounds of it, we might be exploring Goodwill Hunting instead. I am looking forward to it. Excellent. Well, thank you very much for your time. Bye.
