Kev: 00:00
Hello and welcome back to the No Context Cinema Club, a show where one man's cinematic knowledge is assessed, judged, and ultimately ridiculed as we explore Rob's spectacular ignorance of film history. Each week, Rob attempts to write a movie based only on the title and the potentially misleading snippets of information I'm prepared to give him, before having his efforts judged on coherence, entertainment factor, and originality. This week's rewrite is the Quentin Tarantino classic Reservoir Dogs, a film which really exploded into the cultural zeitgeist in the early to mid nineties, but which I think is fair to say has remained a staple of movie watchers ever since. So just how wrong can Rob be about the plot? Well we're about to find out. Hello Rob.

Rob: 00:35
Hello, Kev. Nice to see you.

Kev: 00:36
Nice to see you too. But before we move into Reservoir Dogs, have you had a chance to watch last week's film Goodwill Hunting?

Rob: 00:42
I tried. I really tried. The opening montage, the opening scenes just took so long. I got five minutes in and I had to turn it up. You did start to watch. I started watching it, yeah, and it's now on my continue watching on Netflix.

Kev: 00:54
Unbelievable.

Rob: 00:55
I got five minutes in.

Kev: 00:56
Okay, well, that's probably five minutes further than I would have got into your version, but alright. Um so you haven't watched it, are you gonna watch it?

Rob: 01:03
Probably not, no.

Kev: 01:04
If it felt a bit too of its time. Okay, in which case, uh I will do a short summary of the film on our separate second podcast, uh, which I'll record a bit later so that we don't waste any time now. Um let's move back straight away then into Reservoir Dogs. And just before we were recording, you shared a particularly frustrating and slightly ludicrous piece of information. Which would you like to share it for us again now?

Rob: 01:29
Yeah, so you you obviously mentioned Reservoir Dogs last week, and I think the revelation is that I used to own the Blu-ray for Reservoir Dogs.

Kev: 01:38
Right.

Rob: 01:39
I I have never watched it.

Kev: 01:41
Okay. Would you like to tell us anything else about your Blu-ray collection?

Rob: 01:46
So this week I've been looking. So for context, I used to have a collection of Blu-rays, hundreds and hundreds of things, and it was more of a collection rather than a hobby of watching them. So I've got a database that I made on Excel.

Kev: 01:60
Wow.

Rob: 02:00
Which has got when I bought it, where I bought it from, how much I paid, how much I saved versus RRP, but nothing about whether I watched it or anything like that.

Kev: 02:09
So to clarify this, the man who has seen no films, possibly owned hundreds of films, categorised them against how much he had saved on buying them, and where are those where are those Blu-rays now?

Rob: 02:23
They've all gone. They've all been sold.

Kev: 02:25
And did you add to your spreadsheet how much you sold them for?

Rob: 02:31
No. The spreadsheet is frozen in time. And I actually the collection is there and it there's a sidebar which says what I wanted to buy next and what I had on order. Reservoir Dogs was on order. It was part of a three for two offer at Xavy. So it was on order. It never made it to the database, but it was on order, along with the Truman Show and something else I can't remember.

Kev: 02:54
Goodness me. Also a film you haven't seen, or did you actually watch it? I have watched the Truman Show. Wow, we found a film he's watched. We found one. Okay, well that I mean that that little aside might have led you to believe just as I do that this is an extended long ploy and trick that he's actually seen all of these films. But uh he still maintains that not to be the case.

Rob: 03:17
I I went through the list and I I can't remember watching two-thirds of the Blu-rays I had in my collection. Excellent.

Kev: 03:25
Well, let's crack on then. So Reservoir Dogs, apart from having previously owned it, you know nothing else about it.

Rob: 03:31
So I know I know the Blu-ray cover.

Kev: 03:32
Oh, that's the extent of my knowledge. Okay, well you might have to pretend you don't know it, I suppose, if you're kind of come up with some things. I suppose it might reveal some thoughts, or have you based some of your thoughts on what you can remember about it?

Rob: 03:43
So since we've spoken last week, I've come up with two different options for what the film could be based on based on what my thoughts are.

Kev: 03:50
So it sounds like we're about to segue nicely into our first section called Plot Luck.

Rob: 03:56
So the first one is taking the uh Blu-ray cover into account, which if I remember rightly is is red with some silhouetted people walking across it or or towards you or something like that.

Kev: 04:06
Yeah, I don't think they're necessarily silhouetted, but yeah, not not too bad.

Rob: 04:11
That's what that's my memory. This might have been 15 years ago, I reckon. I reckon it was 2009, the last time I looked at this spreadsheet. So uh anyway, so the f the first film's based on that, really, because of that little bit of an extra knowledge. Uh so the first option, and I'm gonna I'm actually gonna let you choose which option we go through this week.

Kev: 04:28
That is the theme of the show. I get to choose every week, it's just last week I humoured you.

Rob: 04:32
And listening back, you probably shouldn't have. Yeah, I regret that. Um so the first option is a gritty crime film based in rural Wales, where an unemployed local forms a vigilante group whose motives are exposed at great personal cost. Okay, where's the reservoir fit? Or the dogs?

Kev: 04:53
Or is it just a metaphor for something we find out later?

Rob: 04:56
So the the vigilante group are called the reservoir docks. Ah. So the reservoir has been closed down by the company, mining it or whatever. Mining it? Yep. The reservoir. Yep. What what is a reservoir, Rob? Uh a big hole. Filled with water. Oh. Are you thinking of a quarry? Is a quarry not just a reservoir with water in it?

Kev: 05:21
Well, it's a quarry, I suppose, is a reservoir without water in it.

Rob: 05:24
So empty reservoir dogs. So, or quarry dogs. Quarry dogs. Uh both of these are based on quarries. Empty reservoirs.

Kev: 05:34
We can run with that. It doesn't really matter, does it? That's fine. Okay. So a bunch of vigilantes in rural Wales. Rural Wales. Rural Wales. Because Vinny Jones is a lead, naturally.

Rob: 05:43
I believe he's from Wales. Uh yes, he played for Wales, I think. Did he not? Think so. Must have. And Wimbledon. In his skinhead bad boy heyday.

Kev: 05:53
You know that Vinny Jones was also an actor, yeah?

Rob: 05:55
Yeah.

Kev: 05:56
This is where this is. I don't I don't know what was he in.

Rob: 05:59
No, I have no idea. Okay.

Kev: 06:01
Well, let's not ruin a p a future episode with that then. Just silence of me thinking the 20 minutes. Okay. Alright. So that's option one. What's option two?

Rob: 06:09
Uh option two is a live-action uh animal film, a bit Disney style. Right. Where a young boy becomes the leader of a pack of lost dogs and finds himself being an unsuspected hero.

Kev: 06:21
So a young boy and then a bunch of dogs. Yep. Okay. Uh and when you say live action, are you thinking like the Lion King remakes recently where it's kind of CGI'd, or are we talking like Pixar style animation?

Rob: 06:33
No, this is this is live action, so this is more Lion King remake where there's a real boy with real dog.

Kev: 06:39
Okay. In which case we're definitely going with option two.

Rob: 06:45
I kind of know that's further away from the truth based on the DVD cover, the Blu-ray cover.

Kev: 06:50
And I I it's less I am going to enjoy this, I think quite a lot. Um so you are locked into this being a live action kids' film, basically.

Rob: 07:01
Yep. Yeah, it's a it's a not a coming of age story, but it it's very much a Disney. I I want to say Lassie, is that a film?

Kev: 07:09
Well it was it was a dog.

Rob: 07:11
I think it was a film where it is like a big TV show, probably a nice uplifting film about like the morals of growing up as a kid in America.

Kev: 07:18
Uh we're in America then not rural wilds now.

Rob: 07:20
Yeah, we're not we're no longer in rural wilds.

Kev: 07:22
Okay, so uh but Vinny Jones is gonna be in it, right? As the voice. Probably not as the young boy. It's like maybe as the voice of a dog.

Rob: 07:29
If you want to do the voice of the dog as Vinnie Jones, more than welcome to.

Kev: 07:32
Vinny is very much in.

Rob: 07:35
The dogs don't talk.

Kev: 07:36
They don't speak at all. No. So there's one character who talks.

Rob: 07:40
There's more than one character.

Kev: 07:42
Oh, okay. So the dogs are tangential. Yeah. That's very disappointing, and I think I might force that to not be the case. But as we move into our next section, which is, of course, the plot thickens. This is the part where I sort of lead you will give you a few snippets of information to sort sort of help develop it. But before we get any further into that, you don't want the dogs to talk, is that right?

Rob: 08:03
I I hadn't planned for them to talk.

Kev: 08:05
Right. So go on then, outline again what's what's happening in the film.

Rob: 08:09
So it's set in the American suburbs, the character is a young boy. Did you ever watch Malcolm in the Middle?

Kev: 08:15
I have seen bits and pieces of it, yeah. Do you remember Dewey?

Rob: 08:19
Dewey? I don't know enough about that. The youngest brother, right? That's the character I've got in mind. Okay. A young, unpopular, likable, but he gets a little bit bullied at school. A little bit goofy. A little bit goofy, yeah.

Kev: 08:32
Wacky. Talks to dogs. Talks to dogs who don't talk to him but might soon.

Rob: 08:35
I suppose they could talk to him. I think they should talk to him. I really do feel like that. Well, they're gonna have to if Vinnie Jones is in, actually. That's the voice of a dog. Unless he's just gonna woof a lot. Paid a lot for that. We got Winnie, we got Vinny Jones, lads, but he is gonna woof. Paying loads of top actors. I don't know if he was a top actor, but to just bark.

Kev: 08:53
Yeah, definitely. Right, okay, so good. I've managed to convince you to get the dogs talking. I think they should talk. Right, so they live in the reservoir slash quarry.

Rob: 09:01
So the opening scene is he is looking sad, the boy, this is Dewey. He's looking sad and lost. He's lost his best mate, and he's putting up lost dog signs around the town he lives in.

Kev: 09:13
Okay, so he's got some posters out, missing dog, that sort of thing. Yeah. All right, what sort of dog are we looking at?

Rob: 09:18
Uh help us help us visualize this film. I don't know any dog titles.

Kev: 09:23
This can't be another thing he doesn't know. Um is he a Dalmatian? Is he one of 101 Dalmatians?

Rob: 09:28
No, he's got long uh I think Lassie. I'm thinking Lassie.

Kev: 09:32
I think that's some sort of like a collie-ish kind of thing. We'll say that, we'll say that.

Rob: 09:36
That's what I had in my head when I was coming up with this crap.

Kev: 09:39
Okay, right. So it's Lassie. Spectacular originality. What do you expect? Like a talking dog called Lassie, right? So he's missing Lassie.

Rob: 09:50
Yeah.

Kev: 09:50
Are we calling it Lassie? Or are we? No, we'll Can I give you his name then? Oh yeah, please do. Good. He will be Mr. White.

Rob: 09:58
The dog's called Mr. White.

Kev: 10:00
The dog's called Mr. White. Yeah, alright. If you if you want him to be white, that's fine, but equally, he doesn't actually have to be white, it could be more like an ironic. He's he's brown and white. He's brown and white. Predominantly white?

Rob: 10:10
Or not necessarily. No, he's brown and white, whatever Lassie looks like. He looks exactly like Lassie. I don't know.

Kev: 10:14
I think he was sort of mostly golden, golden brown, wasn't he? Golden brown and white. And white. Right, so Mr. White, voiced not by Vinny Jones or voiced by Vinnie Jones? Well, he's gonna have to have to do that. Because you said there's gonna be a pack of dogs.

Rob: 10:26
Yeah, we we don't know any other dogs yet.

Kev: 10:28
Okay, so do you want this one to be Vinny or do you want this to be somebody else?

Rob: 10:31
This this is gonna be the main dog.

Kev: 10:33
And is that Vinny or is Vinnie? It's gonna have to be Vinny, isn't it? A Welsh Welsh lassie. But uh in fairness, in most films that I can remember Vinny Jones in, he doesn't sound very Welsh. He sounds he sounds cockney. I don't know if he is now. I'm having a crisis of confidence.

Rob: 10:48
He's definitely played for Wales. I think he played for Wales.

Kev: 10:51
I think he might be one of those sort of non-Welsh Welsh people.

Rob: 10:54
I think we should have him as a Welsh accent. So he's doing Welsh in Lassie in the media.

Kev: 10:60
In a Welsh dog accent.

Rob: 11:02
Yep. So the uh the main character is walking through the woods on the way home from putting their posters up.

Kev: 11:08
Yep.

Rob: 11:09
And he finds his dog, Mr. White.

Kev: 11:11
He finds Mr. White White and the movie is over, just like that.

Rob: 11:14
In the woods. But Mr. White's with two other dogs. With two other dogs?

Kev: 11:18
Two other dogs. And and they uh are they friendly dogs or friendly dogs?

Rob: 11:22
All friendly dogs at this point.

Kev: 11:23
Okay, then um if Mr. White at the start really the best other dogs that he should be with uh to maintain parallels with hero films are Mr.

Rob: 11:33
Pink and Mr. Orange. So Mr. Orange is a golden lab, bit looks like orange, and Mr. Pink is a poodle. Brilliant. Mr.

Kev: 11:43
Pink is a poodle.

Rob: 11:44
Sure, then one of them poodles with like big tails and they are dead. Properly sort of I don't know if that's legal anymore to die poodles pink, but in this film it was.

Kev: 11:51
Well, yeah, sure. And also it's a sort of live action thing, they probably CGI anyway.

Rob: 11:55
Yeah, I may have misunderstood live action. Just they're just real dogs.

Kev: 11:60
Okay, that's that's not what I think of. Alright. So Mr. Pink, who is a a poodle.

Rob: 12:06
Yeah, Mr. Gold. Mr. Orange. Mr. Orange is a golden retriever. Mr. Orange is the golden retriever. And Mr. White is a predominantly brown. Possibly collie. Okay, yeah. That's but on so far.

Kev: 12:19
Okay, alright.

Rob: 12:20
So they're walking through the woods. Yep, he sees Mr. White and these two other friends, and they turn around, hightail it off into the woods. So Mr. White doesn't want to be found. It's not that he doesn't want to be found, it's that he's trying to enchant entice the main character into the woods.

Kev: 12:37
Oh that enticing a young boy into the woods feels darker than a your classic Disney, but especially it's a dog, and they're probably gonna discover some magical adventures, I suppose. Especially when it's Vinnie Jones. Especially when it's Vinnie Jones voiced by Vinnie Jones. Come this way, what?

Rob: 12:52
I've just realized I've not given the main character a name. Uh I think we were calling him Dewey.

Kev: 12:56
Oh, that's because he's that character involved on the. Yeah, go on, we'll see.

Rob: 12:59
I'm gonna call him Dave.

Kev: 13:00
Dave. You don't want to call him Nice Guy Eddie?

Rob: 13:03
We can call him Eddie. Alright.

Kev: 13:04
Eddie's a nice guy. Well you can have Eddie or Joe.

Rob: 13:06
No, Eddie, nice guy Eddie's alright.

Kev: 13:08
Nice guy Eddie.

Rob: 13:09
Eddie's gonna be a nice guy. Spoiler alert. Okay, well. So it's not an ironic thing. But it it is important not yet. It is important to know that he's not popular. Although he's nice. He he's not popular, he's a bit lonely, a bit sad. Alright. Um so the dogs have obviously hightailed into the woods, and nice guy Eddie is following them. They rummage through a metal chain link fence off into the quarry. Quarry slash reservoir. Slash reservoir. Um and he follows them. He follows them all the way, climbs under the fence, and uh he crawls into the abandoned reservoir.

Rob: 13:46
Okay.

Kev: 13:47
There he is in potentially a dangerous sort of area, I would think.

Rob: 13:51
Danger signs everywhere.

Kev: 13:53
Danger keep out.

Rob: 13:54
Danger keep out, guarded by dogs. Guarded by dogs. Oh, lots more dogs. The the signs say guarded by dogs. I've got I'd say right here.

Kev: 14:02
Um the pink poodle and the golden retrieval or labor or whatever it was. Mr. Pink is Mr. Pink is gonna be possibly the most professional of the dogs, just so you know when it comes to it.

Rob: 14:15
Yep, that's probably not a plan I had, but there we go, there we go. So um actually, when he when he crawls through the fence, he kind of stands up, goes through a bit of a hedge trying to find his dog and his dog's mate. Unbelievable. And uh he looks up and he and he finds a uh like a Robinson Crusoe style dog village. Weren't expecting that, were you?

Kev: 14:37
No, because I'm not quite sure what a Robinson Crusoe style dog village would be.

Rob: 14:41
If you never come across some of these before, there's like loads of handmade dog houses, walkways, areas he can go and get some water, things they can play with, that sort of thing.

Kev: 14:52
Okay.

Rob: 14:53
And loads of dogs. It's like a little dog village, but clearly handmade by the.

Kev: 14:56
And the dogs are all getting on, are they?

Rob: 14:58
Oh yeah, they're all happy as Larry. Wow. Happy as Lassie. Happy as lassie.

Kev: 15:02
Might not last long, um, based on some curve holes I'm about to throw you away. Oh good. Um so Mr. White, who is our sort of main Lassie type character, if I remember correctly, um Mr. White is gonna have to put his trust in the wrong place and the wrong people, and he's gonna have to uh you know have his loyalty ultimately has to backfire on him. Just so you know.

Rob: 15:26
It's almost the opposite of where this film's going. Not anymore. Not anymore. Right, okay. Not according to the rules of the no context cinema club. So Lassey is still leaving leading nice guy Eddie somewhere. Yep. Eddie's following him through this village and takes the the end up at a full-size human house. Handmade, but clearly for people. Full size human house. Yes, that's what I'm sticking with. I said it and I'm sticking with it. Alright, in the middle of a quarry slash reservoir. Full of Robinson Crusoe style dog houses, yes.

Kev: 15:57
Okay, right, yep.

Rob: 15:58
This is exactly where you thought this was going, isn't it?

Kev: 16:00
Yeah, big time. Pretty predictable at this point.

Rob: 16:04
But there's there's someone in there. Oh no. There's an old guy in there. And now imagine the and I I think I I'll try and make this the last Home Alone reference for the whole podcast, because I've watched more films in Home Alone to have reference to. Do you know the Pigeon Lady in Home Alone? Yeah, of course. Imagine the pigeon lady but a dog man. A dog man, but he's looking after all the dogs.

Kev: 16:27
Is he gonna speak in a really low southern drawl that makes it sort of sound like he's about to send everyone to sleep?

Rob: 16:36
Exactly, but not because that's not the sort of person he is. He's talking like that because he's not well. Oh, okay. He needs medical assistance.

Kev: 16:42
His name's gonna have to be K Billy.

Rob: 16:46
K Billy.

Kev: 16:47
K Billy. That's his name. Okay.

Rob: 16:49
I'm glad you're naming all the characters because I didn't have a name for these people. Or dogs.

Kev: 16:53
I'd I'd like to just add that little bit of colour to K Billy with the with the voice for you, huh?

Rob: 16:58
You can do the voice at every point for him now. So you're gonna have to. As I said, K Billy needs medical assistance, and the dogs have led Eddie. Nice guy Eddie. Nice guy Eddie to the house to help Kay Billy.

Kev: 17:11
Oh, okay. So they weren't just trying to get uh nice guy Eddie to come and have a look around. They're doing a very lassie style thing of actually trying to re what's that, Lassie?

Rob: 17:23
There's somebody somebody ill in the old quarry. The only reference I've got to lassey is that there's somebody who's stuck down a well, and I've never watched anything else.

Kev: 17:30
Yeah, that but that's exactly it. But instead of a well, he's in a reservoir. He's like an empty reservoir. It's a bit like a well, a really wide well.

Rob: 17:38
And much less water. Um so that basically when when they get there, nice guy Eddie uh turns on his nice guy act, and the dogs have trusted him. They've put their try Mr. White, whatever he's called. Yeah, Mr. White trusted Nice Gay Eddie to take Kay Billy to the hospital, and that's exactly what Nice Guy Eddie does.

Kev: 18:01
Okay, right. Well that feels like the opening act of the film rather than Okay, right, good.

Rob: 18:06
So that's not that's not it.

Kev: 18:09
Okay, so that was almost a character introduction thing. Yeah. So we met Nice Guy Eddie, we met Kay Billy, who maybe used to be a radio show presenter, played hits from the 70s, sounds of the super seventies.

Rob: 18:24
I I I quite like that because I think Eddie's a nostalgic and thoughtful character, but he's he's living with dogs at the end of the day, so yeah. Ultimately. He's um he's not well respected around town, but I think he harks back to those days when he was clearly respected as a radio.

Kev: 18:39
Does it can he hear the dogs, or is it only Nice Guy Eddie that can talk to the animals like Doctor Doolittle?

Rob: 18:44
I I think they could they've got a connection with an individual dog each.

Kev: 18:48
Oh. So can Nice Guy Eddy only talk to Mr. White?

Rob: 18:53
No. Yes, yes, Nice Guy Eddie can only talk to Mr. White, but Kay Billy. Who's Kay Billy's? He's got an old dog that's that sits with him and a bit bit older.

Kev: 19:02
Ooh. Uh I think that should be Mr. Blonde. Yes. Yeah, I thought yeah, that was he's older, is he? Yeah, older, yeah. Um is he gonna end up being a pretty incidental character who we never really see after we've met him once? Yeah. And let's make him Mr. Blue.

Rob: 19:15
Mr. Blue. Mr. Blue. And he is a blue French something. There's a there's a there's a sort of blue dog.

Rob: 19:22
What's it called?

Kev: 19:23
Are you thinking of a Belgian blue? Because that's a cow. That's that really muscular big cow.

Rob: 19:29
No, I'm sure there's a sort of little dog that's blue. Anyway, it's a dog. Sure, there's many blue dogs naturally, but it's not naturally blue, but it's it's like a grey blue. A grey thing. Yeah, okay. But anyway, it's it's an old dog, it's an old dog. Who accompanies them to the hospital, obviously.

Kev: 19:43
Of course. Okay, but we never really see much of Mr. Blue again.

Rob: 19:46
No, or Kay Billy, because sadly he dies in hospitals. You've killed off Kay Billy so early. That's not a your voice. But there is a line. I've got a line. Oh yeah, what's that? Um Kay Billy says the last thing he says to Good Gayadi is Nice Gaiadi. Nice Gaiadi. Remember, nice Gayeti's not very popular, doesn't have loads of friends. And the last thing Kay Billy says with his last breath is them dogs are my friends no matter what.

Kev: 20:12
Them dogs are my friends no matter what. Now I'll leave you to hear the fine tunes of Steeler's Wheel with the hit Stuck in the Middle With You. And then and then we hear Stuck in the Middle Way You. I think you should just put the song in there. Well, for reasons not related to my fundamental lack of understanding of copyright, I'm not gonna put this in.

Rob: 20:34
At some point you're gonna have to Google copyright laws to see what.

Kev: 20:36
Well, spoiler alert, I have, and I'm none the wiser. Right. Alright, so K Billy has put on his final record. Yep. Shuffled off to small coil, stuck in the middle with you, left that for nice guy Eddie. Now Nice Guy Eddie's in the hospital with Mr. White, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink. Yeah, Mr.

Rob: 20:57
Mr.

Kev: 20:58
Blue will stay with K Billy and go and tend his grave and kind of natural thing for a doctor do.

Rob: 21:04
Yeah. By tending it, do you not tend it, talking his leg. Making sure the plants are worked. Just just ten uh just staying there and and making sure he's not lonely in the afterlife. Okay, well, all right, fine.

Kev: 21:17
So and that's the last we see of Mr. Blue. So that that is very on brand for the real film.

Rob: 21:21
Excellent. That's a tick, that's a point, surely.

Kev: 21:23
Yeah, yeah. Well, maybe. I mean, I did tell you about it, so it feels like it's a victory for me rather than you, but you're not being scored on those.

Rob: 21:30
No, I'm not being scored. Um, so good guy Ellie Ellie. Good guy, Eddie.

Kev: 21:35
Nice guy, Eddie.

Rob: 21:37
Can we call him good guy Eddie?

Kev: 21:38
Yeah, let's have him be good guy, Eddie, because you're just gonna keep making the mistake and it's gonna slow us down.

Rob: 21:42
You're gonna have to correct me every time.

Kev: 21:44
So he he he obviously If you now call him nice guy, Eddie, I'm gonna have to correct you and say good guy Eddie.

Rob: 21:49
Brilliant. Uh I'll try not to do that. Uh good guy Eddie obviously soon finds himself back at the quarry and he finds himself like looking after the dogs. There's loads of dogs in the quarry that have Been left. It's definitely a quarry now, by the way, not a reservoir. And he finds himself sourcing food for them, playing with the dogs, rebuilding the houses and starting to build onto what that little Robinson Crusoe style village in the quarry.

Kev: 22:15
Is that is this the point where Mr. Blonde, a psychopathic and very unpredictable dog, might enter the fray?

Rob: 22:22
Do we not have a Mr. Oh, Mr. Blond's a new one?

Kev: 22:24
Yeah.

Rob: 22:25
This is hard to keep up with.

Kev: 22:26
Mr. Blonde is new.

Rob: 22:28
Mr. Blonde, it doesn't come in just yet.

Kev: 22:30
Okay, alright. Just know that you've got a plan for him to there is another dog. Well he's gonna have to be sort of psychopathic and extremely unstable and dangerous.

Rob: 22:38
And that is a representation of his owner. Oh, hello. Because good guy Eddie. Yep. He doesn't run away from home, but he does spend most of his time at the uh the quarry skipping school, but cementing his isolation. And then one day while he's there, he he's going to source some food for the dogs, and he uh he bumps into a group of bullies. Oh no. One of them has a dog called Mr. Blonde. Mr. Blonde. Mr. Blonde. And he is like chief bully.

Kev: 23:08
Um he's gonna be a German shepherd, I hope.

Rob: 23:10
So Beethoven? Two. Uh what's that, a bloodhound? That horrible little black and brown thing that's it that's protecting the with the weird droopy eyes. No, not.

Kev: 23:21
Is that Beethoven or is it?

Rob: 23:22
No, that's the guard dog. The quint like the quintessential guard dog with the pointy ears. Is that what it's an Alsacian? One of them.

Kev: 23:28
Yeah, I think that's the same type of dog, I think, but might be wrong. This isn't a dog podcast. Yet. Well, I think with us as hosts, it's never likely to be, is it? Because you don't know any dogs. And I've probably mislabelled several.

Rob: 23:42
So the kids from school they they bump into him and they bully him in the woods for being for being weird.

Kev: 23:48
Oh, well, that's not cool.

Rob: 23:50
That's that's it. That's the end. Well, I hope it isn't the other. It's of course not the end. Good guy Eddie goes back to the quarry feeling sorry for himself, licking his wounds.

Kev: 24:02
Not literally because he's not a dog.

Rob: 24:03
Correct, but he's the leader of the pack at this point.

Kev: 24:05
He is. Oh so maybe you should literally lick his wounds.

Rob: 24:07
And he's having a a confidence, a crisis, conf confidence of crisis? Crisis of confidence. Thank you. I nearly said that. Yeah. Um, and the the dogs, uh, Mr White, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Orange. Orange, thank you, are worried that they've put their trust in the in the wrong guy here. Because who are they trusting at the moment? They're trusting good guy, Eddie. Yeah. But he's wavering. Because he's been bullied for being weird, he's second guessing whether he should stay and pretty much live with the dogs at the tender age of eleven. Whatever it is.

Kev: 24:39
He's running away from home to live in the in the quarry with the dogs. By the way, is it gonna take a K Billy's house?

Rob: 24:44
Yeah, yeah, that's what he's done. He's giving a dog.

Kev: 24:47
He's not running that Robinson Crusoe dog village. But it's in the house.

Rob: 24:51
It's it's a homemade. The real size human house, as you called it. Yeah, it's a real-sized human house. He spends most of his time there. He's not run away from home. Right. But he's cemented his isolation in that place. Well, okay. Um but while he's having a crisis of confidence, and uh the dogs you can see, or they're obviously telling him through Vinny Jones' voice that you you need to stay and look after us. We we need you to be the leader of the pack, and he's not sure. Do you want to do the voice? Um of who? Vinny Jones, saying he needs to be the leader of the pack.

Kev: 25:20
You're gonna have to be the leader of the pack, man. Alright.

Rob: 25:23
Pac-Man?

Kev: 25:24
Yeah, leader of the pack, man.

Rob: 25:27
And Pac-Man, he's over there as well. Um, and then as he's coming up, or trying to make his mind up about whether he stays with the dogs or goes back, he hears a scream of help in the woods. A cry for help.

Kev: 25:39
A cry for help. Yep. A dog cry or a human cry? Human cry. Human cry, another human's coming in. Probably called Marvin Nash, if it's a new character.

Rob: 25:48
No, not a new character.

Kev: 25:49
Not a new character, rewind, carry on.

Rob: 25:51
This is the owner of Mr Mr. Blonde. Blonde, thank you. He was gonna be Mr. Yellow then. And Mr. Blonde has had an injury. Oh no. So despite Wait, Mr. Blonde has, or Mr. Blonde is injured. The dog. The dog. Right. Okay. I don't know if we named the bully.

Kev: 26:09
No, I don't think we did.

Rob: 26:11
Mr. Blonde is a representation of the bully.

Kev: 26:13
Yeah. We didn't we didn't name him, and I can't be bothered, to be honest.

Rob: 26:17
He's so ingrained in this film I can tell. Um so Eddie goes running, he he finds out that his his chief bully is uh with an injured dog.

Kev: 26:27
So he's got a bit of a uh moral and ethical dilemma. Am I gonna help my bully? Yeah. A man who's ruined my life.

Rob: 26:35
Leave him to die.

Kev: 26:37
Leave him to die. Brutal. But nice. Well he's called Good Guy Eddie, so I hope that you know well, actually I mean leave it to die, to be honest, but uh now I must warn you, this is Disney, so the ending's gonna be very bland.

Rob: 26:49
Well, it might, it depends. And we are getting to the end. Are we? Good guy Eddie decides to take him back to the reservoir. With Mr. Blonde. With Mr. Blonde. Excellent. Takes the bully and Mr. Blonde back to the to the reservoir and promises, despite how bad the bully is, he's gonna tend to the dog and make sure he's safe.

Kev: 27:10
Okay, alright, so he's taking responsibility for Mr. Blonde. Absolutely. So he has introduced Mr. Blonde to this friendly commune of happy dogs. Well then I would say Mr. White probably has put his trust in the wrong place. Because in a minute, Mr. Blonde has got to turn pretty psychopathic.

Rob: 27:28
Okay, so uh Good Guy Eddy obviously doesn't kill Mr. Blonde then.

Kev: 27:31
No, good guy eddy. Well, I mean, not Good Guy Eddy isn't gonna kill Mr. Blonde now. Oh well, I mean he might later, I suppose. When you said it was near the end of the film, I'm not sure it yet is, um, because we've got to spend a bit of time exploring Mr. Blonde's breakdown of just we've got to discover just how crazy he is, really.

Rob: 27:50
Um why are they why are they all colours?

Kev: 27:53
Is this Well, because that's what they're called in reservoir dogs. Yeah, I know but like you're Mr.

Rob: 27:59
Fucking Pink. Mr. Fucking Pink.

Kev: 28:02
You're not Mr. Purple, you're Mr. Fucking Pink. And I would tell you right now, that's the best impression I'm ever gonna do. Wow. That that one is you could run that through some sort of gadget that bears sound clips, I would and and that will come up 100% match for the real film.

Rob: 28:19
I would get a patent for that gadget because it doesn't exist, but I would AI does everything now, mate.

Kev: 28:24
AI does everything.

Rob: 28:25
Surely it's Mr. Fucking Pink the Poodle.

Kev: 28:27
I mean you see face off. They could take a man's face off. That actually went down on my list of films I want to watch, just went down on my list of films that uh that I wanted to watch as well after I watched it for the remack. Anyway, um okay, so Mr. Blonde is gonna go crazy.

Rob: 28:42
So he's been brought into the fold. Yeah. Good guy ideas brought him back to health. Innocently, but maybe naively. But naively, and proving to Mr. White that he's put his trust in the wrong person. Yeah.

Kev: 28:53
When when does Mr. Blonde um cut off someone's ear? In this Disney film.

Rob: 29:00
Just checking my notes, I think that's the next line. With a razor blade.

Kev: 29:04
Whilst dancing. With And singing a bit.

Rob: 29:07
This would have fit my other film, actually.

Kev: 29:09
Yeah, that's why I chose this one.

Rob: 29:11
There was a lot This is di this is Disney.

Kev: 29:14
Yeah, well might be the end of Disney.

Rob: 29:17
So I I I think what can happen, I I can't introduce a razor blade, I think that's a bit dark for a Disney film.

Kev: 29:22
Okay, what's he gonna cut his his ear off with? I think Mr. Blonde's just gonna chew it off. Is that better?

Rob: 29:27
Mr Mr. Blonde has obviously been brought up with a bully. He doesn't know any better, he's lived in isolation, he's now in this friendly place, and there's dog the dog's there, he feels they can take advantage of them and they're not gonna defend themselves. So he's going around taking all the food, playing with all the toys, doing whatever he wants. None of the dogs are prepared to stand up to him. Mr. White, meanwhile, is saying, Come on, good guy Eddie, we we trusted you and you're letting us down. So Mr. White, no, good guy Eddie, banishes Mr. Blonde, who refuses to leave.

Kev: 30:04
Of course he refuses to leave. And that's when he goes mad and cuts off someone's ear. Gets into a fight with Mr. White. With Mr. White? Yeah, and bites his ear off. No, okay, alright. So he's bitten off Mr. White's ear. Yep. Or Mr. White, who's our kind of favourite dog? Is he supposed to be our favourite dog?

Rob: 30:19
He's the one that's the first one we met and Charlie Jones. He's the one that can apparently talk to a good guy idiot as well. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he he's our main dog.

Kev: 30:26
Oh hang on, there's an opportunity here to put in a good line from the film um when they're maybe squaring off because I think someone needs to say well actually Mr. Blonde needs to say, Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy? Or are you gonna bite?

Rob: 30:42
Perfect. I mean, that could be written for this film.

Kev: 30:46
Yeah, well it's in.

Rob: 30:48
Yeah, easy.

Kev: 30:49
So that's what Mr. Blonde says, yeah?

Rob: 30:51
That's exactly what he says, yeah.

Kev: 30:53
Okay, perfect. So he's he's just said, Are you gonna bark all day all night, little doggy, or are you gonna bite? And then they get in a bit of a fight.

Rob: 30:59
Getting a scrap. Yeah. Mr. White's ears gone.

Kev: 31:02
Gone. Clean. Just like that, gone. And then with a razor blade, even though it's Disney.

Rob: 31:08
You've added the razor blade twice at this point. The razor blade is a big one. The razor blade's got to be there. But then um potentially Mr Blonde's owner has a razor blade previously in the film. Yeah, yeah. Because he is a bully. He is a bully and uh he's an is a dog embodiment of his bully owner, so maybe that's where that comes in. So anyway, eventually Mr. Blonde realises what he's done.

Kev: 31:30
So just as a recap, Mr. Blue as an embodiment of K Billy is well you can we can consider him dead.

Rob: 31:38
He's out of the film.

Kev: 31:39
Perfect. Yeah. Um Mr Blonde is a psychopath. As an embodiment of his bully owner. Mr. White, who is Vinnie Jones and is Good Guy Eddy's kind of spirit animal, is now earless and regretting trusting Good Guy Eddie for bringing this terrible factor into his Robertson Crusoe-esque dog village quarry. Quarry. In the quarry. Okay. Um Mr. Poodle. Uh sorry, Mr. Pink. The poodle. Mr. Fucking Pink the Poodle. Yeah. Mr. You're not Mr. Purple, you're Mr. Fucking Pink. Mr. Pink the Poodle is the only one looking around going, man, these guys have lost their minds. Does that fit?

Rob: 32:21
Yeah, what we don't know though, yet, is Mr. Pink used to be white, but he was a fighting dog and the blood has soaked his fur pink. I've just added this in. I've no idea where this is going.

Kev: 32:32
No, he's not pink per se. He's just been sort of stained pink from all the blood from the blood.

Rob: 32:37
So he defends Mr. White. Mr. Blonde scurries off into the phone.

Kev: 32:42
Oh, he successfully defends Mr.

Rob: 32:43
White? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's he's a hard one, Mr. Pink, the fucking poodle.

Kev: 32:47
Okay, so we've sworn a lot in this episode. So Mr. Pink is protecting Mr. White and driving out Mr. Blonde.

Rob: 32:56
Essentially doing what good guy Eddie should have done.

Kev: 32:58
Doing what good guy Eddie should have done.

Rob: 32:60
And let everyone down.

Kev: 33:01
Okay. So at what point does one of the dogs say I'm fucking dying here? I'm fucking dying.

Rob: 33:12
I I think that's said earlier in the film in quite a funny way.

Kev: 33:16
Okay, what like dying with laughter?

Rob: 33:18
Yeah, we've just got one funny dog who who comic relief dog. I'm desperate not to put a montage in this film, but I think. Nice guy Eddie gets to the quarry for the first time. He's shown around the the quarry and by a uh host, an MC, who's very funny, very witty, New York accent, uh Seth Rogan sort of character, maybe voicing him. Right. And he's shown Is he from New York? I don't know. He could do a good New York accent, I reckon. Sure. Showing him round and then uh he's making a joke, and then somebody says, You're killing me here.

Kev: 33:51
I'm fucking dying here. That's that's the one.

Rob: 33:54
Okay.

Kev: 33:55
Alright. Well, in the film, they say it's the details that tell the story, and some of these details have told a story. I'm not sure it's a story that do you want to know the ending?

Rob: 34:07
Do you want to know? We better had, yeah, we better had. So obviously Mr. Blonde has run away, scurried off into the into the woods, but he bumps into the his bully, the owner. His owner, the bully. Right, yeah. And he Wait, who was running off into the woods? Mr. Blonde. Okay, the bully leaves Mr. Blonde with Nice Guy Eddy. Of course. And he scurries off into the woods. Yeah. And back to his bully owner. Back to his bully owner, who is coming. Who's still just hanging around in the woods? No, no, he's walking even though good guy Eddie has nursed him back to full health. Here's the twist. He's walking back to the village with his friends. Oh, hello. Trouble afoot. And they have discovered in the most bland Disney ending of all time that you can't judge a book by its colour, Kev. No. You can't judge Good Guy Eddie. There's not a damn scene turn, is there? Yeah. They're going back to help Good Guy Eddy with the village and to look after the dogs. And there is a big difference with the way Mr. Blonde is reacting, running away, and the the bully. Yeah. And contrast in spirit animals. They've gone to help. Yeah.

Kev: 35:18
So what's gonna happen with Mr.

Rob: 35:19
Blonde? He's got to be accepted back into the dog.

Kev: 35:21
He's gone or he's coming back.

Rob: 35:22
He's got to be accepted back into so he's got to have some sort of spin-off film, I think, probably Reservoir Dog 2. Okay. Quarry dogs. Sorry. The quarry dogs back to the quarry. Where he's he's redeeming the marker and what he has to do to get back into the into the park. But essentially they go back. Don't forget, this is Disney. You added the razors in and the blood.

Kev: 35:41
Well Quentin Tarantino added the the razors and the blood, uh, reservoir dogs.

Rob: 35:46
Could he could he direct this?

Kev: 35:48
My version of this film, if you think I've not I've not seen a Quentin Tarantino directed Disney film film, but if Quentin Tarantino directed Disney films, there would be razor blades, there would be blood. So yeah, I can see it. So there you go. Alright, so Quentin Tarantino directs a heartwarming Disney tale of graphic violence and explicit language.

Rob: 36:08
It's a coming of age for the bully. He is the one who learns the lesson. Good guy is just himself all the way through, and he stays true to his colours, true to his values.

Kev: 36:19
I regret not naming the bully, because that would have made things clear.

Rob: 36:22
He's probably the lead character without me even knowing.

Kev: 36:24
Well, the redemption arc, he can be called Marvin Nash, because there was a character called that in there.

Rob: 36:29
That's what I've called him.

Kev: 36:30
He wasn't a particularly massive character either, but he was in it. Why does Mr. Pink disparage waitressing?

Rob: 36:40
I I don't Why doesn't he?

Kev: 36:44
Fair point. And again, just like local property developers last week, all the waitresses out there, if you don't want to be disparaged by Mr. Pink for your job, get a different job.

Rob: 36:54
Going back to the uh the the MC who's who's taking good gay around the fur tour, take gay Billy.

Kev: 37:02
Gay Billy.

Rob: 37:02
No, super 70s. Oh uh the one the one who's who's a the bully. No, keep up. The Seth Roger. Yeah, him. He was a dog. Yeah, he's a dog. You said he can talk, not me. Uh he's doing a tour and Mr. Pink is with them, and they go into a bar and introducing the the bar, uh the the waitress isn't doing her job.

Kev: 37:25
Right.

Rob: 37:26
And that's when uh the uh Mr. Pink is rude about the waitress and then banned from the the dog pub forever.

Kev: 37:32
And doesn't kick in a tip.

Rob: 37:33
No, never never goes back.

Kev: 37:35
Wouldn't kick in a tip, wouldn't kick in a tip for a waitress. No, absolutely not.

Rob: 37:41
That's what it's like, you've seen the film.

Kev: 37:42
Yeah, it's like I've seen the film. Okay. Alright. Well, there's there's reservoir dogs reimagined. Um well yeah, I don't not quite sure what to say about that. Um, but it must be time to uh check the scores on the doors. So uh starting off as always with coherence. There's very few plot holes in this. Very few plot holes because there's very little plot. It's a three from me. It's a three from me, I think, yeah. I mean it makes no sense. Right, I'm sorry, Kev, but still a man just living in a quarry who dies almost immediately, whose place is taken by a an eleven-year-old boy who somehow then lives in the quarry, only to find his bully returning and accept him back into live in the quarry as well.

Rob: 38:30
Look, I'm sorry, at the start of this, I gave you two options one with a very well-rounded Vinnie Jones character and one with some cartoon dogs who are live action and can now speak. Yes. You chose this. I did.

Kev: 38:40
You caused this chaos. Well, and you haven't made anything coherent out of it. So it's a three.

Rob: 38:45
I think the three is valid, but you're to blame.

Kev: 38:48
Well, you can blame me all you like, but your score is three. Um Entertainment Factor. I I would love to see the live action Disney U certificate film.

Rob: 38:58
The razor blade.

Kev: 38:59
Where Mr. Blonde cuts off Mr. White's ear with a razor blade. So I think the entertainment factor in in parts of it are high. All the kind of sentimental um, oh look, he's changed his character and changed his tune and anything. But you've got to remember not interested in that.

Rob: 39:18
You're not the audience for this.

Kev: 39:19
Disney films are very so remind me who the audience is.

Rob: 39:22
Good guy, Eddy.

Kev: 39:23
No, no, he's the main character. Yeah, but it's the audience. Eleven-year-old boys. Eleven-year-old boys and girls, right? And they want to see a dog rip another dog's ear off with a razor belly.

Rob: 39:33
Mind you, that was not the direction I was headed in until you.

Kev: 39:35
But that's the direction you've gone. So who is the audience for this film? Not you. And not 11-year-old. Eleven-year-old boys. So, I mean, there's plenty of other demographics, but I'm not sure many of them will hit or mix for both. But I will give you a solid six for entertainment factor just for the elements that I introduced.

Rob: 39:53
Brilliant. So six and four, and then points go to you. Yeah.

Kev: 39:56
Fair enough. Along with the three for coherence that you were saying are my fault. Um, what's the last one? Uh coherence. Entertainment factor. Originality. I mean it's it's original in places in the juxtaposition of criminal, vicious violence and heartwarming, feel-good Disney schmolz. So I will give you a six for originality. So what's that? Three and seven and six? Sixteen. Sixteen.

Rob: 40:22
Better than my first one.

Kev: 40:23
Uh, what did I give you now? Well, that's ludicrous, then I got fifteen and eighteen. I should really start writing these down.

Rob: 40:32
My memories are very good.

Kev: 40:34
Uh yeah, well, okay. Um, so that's that's Reservoir Dogs as imagined by Rob. And and if you like the sound of it, um seek medical help. Seek medical assistance urgently. Excellent. Well, okay, so I think it's your turn to turn the tables on me. So what have you got for me this week? Once again, before we get any further, not having heard of actually you have heard of Reservoir because you own you used to own it.

Rob: 41:01
I I I've heard of the title.

Kev: 41:02
It's in the front cover. Yeah, so which is the closest we've come? It's the closest we've come to knowing one film.

Rob: 41:07
I I I I really have no idea what the film's about. So for all I know that was apparent. That was apparent.

Kev: 41:14
Anyway, so I'm sorry, what do you got to test me with that isn't going to be in any way? I've made this really easy.

Rob: 41:20
Well, yeah, you the three key saying. This is two weeks in a row now where I've proved to you that you know less about TV than I know about films. No, which is tragic.

Kev: 41:28
That is not what we've proven, but alright.

Rob: 41:30
So I've come up with three really easy questions, and if you don't get two again, you'll get less points than I do as a percentage. And you'll be proved wrong again.

Kev: 41:39
Okay, well, let's see.

Rob: 41:40
So, three questions, and for each of them I'm gonna give you three TV shows. Oh, okay. Uh, the title of the TV show.

Kev: 41:47
Yep.

Rob: 41:48
Two of them real, one of them I've made up. Ooh, nice turn. You've got to uh tell me which is the made up one.

Kev: 41:53
Okay, alright. That sounds that sounds a bit more on par. Easy. Yep. Well, I wouldn't I'm not gonna commit to saying that until I got 100%. Question one.

Rob: 42:01
Yep. And here's the three films again, one of them is made up by me.

Kev: 42:05
Films or TV series? TV series, TV shows, yeah. TV shows, yeah.

Rob: 42:08
So question one, two pints of lager and a packet of crisps. Real. Two bros, one couch, two guys, a girl, and a pizza place.

Kev: 42:16
Whoa. These are TV shows or things on YouTube? TV series. Actual TV series. Yeah. Right. Two pints of lager and a packet of crisps is real. It's got that guy from Holly Oaks in it.

Rob: 42:29
Will Meller?

Kev: 42:30
Yep, that's the fella. He's in it. Uh don't know who else is.

Rob: 42:33
I've got an interesting tidbit about Will Miller.

Kev: 42:34
Okay, we'll save that for the uh extras on the podcast that we're not gonna bother recording. Um, and the other two options were two bros, one couch.

Rob: 42:43
And two guys, a girl, and a pizza place.

Kev: 42:46
I'm gonna go with the last one. Being fake? Yes. No, the middle one fake, sorry. Oh being fake, I want the middle one being fake.

Rob: 42:54
What, two bros, one couch? Yes. Oh, that's a last minute save because that is wrong. That is fake. Uh two guys, a girl, and a pizza place had Ryan Reynolds in it. Did it? And it was very good. And you've heard of Ryan Reynolds, have you? Yeah. My wife likes him a lot. And he runs a football club. So uh yeah, Rexham. Rexham. Uh so yeah, you got that one right. I I think that you saved that very late on. Question two. Yeah. Option one is rockin' chips. That's real.

Kev: 43:18
That's that was the like uh only fools and horses later action thing.

Rob: 43:22
It's a spin off where it's Delboy's a kid.

Kev: 43:24
Yeah, yeah. Oh, as a kid? Yeah, I thought okay.

Rob: 43:26
Alright, yeah. Um and I think So that's real. Nickel Slinhurst is in that, but as a different character. Okay. Anyway. Uh Us and Them. Option two, or Barry and Sons is option three.

Kev: 43:39
Us and them sounds quite real to me. Barry and Sons. I'll go Barry and Sons is made up.

Rob: 43:44
Oh, you've got it right again. So Us and Them is actually the Gavin and Stacey spin off the American.

Kev: 43:48
Oh, you love a spin-off in this in this well, in that particular round of it.

Rob: 43:52
And Barry and Sons, Barry, Gavin and Stacey.

Kev: 43:54
Uh huh, I see what you do. Yeah, yeah.

Rob: 43:56
This is well thought through, you know.

Kev: 43:57
Yeah, it is, but but I'm already ahead of you and scoring. I've won this week already. This one's a freebie. It doesn't even matter. Did say I'd made it easy. Um, you've made it roughly comparable.

Rob: 44:08
Question three. Option one is hello ladies. Option two is good night sweetheart. Real. Nicholas Lindhurst. And my favourite TV show of all time. And option three is suit you, sir.

Kev: 44:20
What's he? That's the catchphrase from the fast show. So I don't think they made a spin-off of that. What was the first option again? Hello ladies. Hello ladies. That sounds like someone's catchphrase as well. What was the middle one that I knew to be brought in? Good night, sweetheart. Good night, sweetheart. That's not a catchphrase. Okay, so I so it's not a catchphrase themed one necessarily. I think that the fake one is suit you, sir. I don't think they made a spin-off of the Fast Show with that.

Rob: 44:46
You are correct. Yeah. Hello Ladies is Stephen Merchant. He did a he did a comedy sitcom night in America. Based on his stand-up called Hello Ladies, so it was a bit of a spin-off.

Kev: 44:58
Well, okay. So I think we've proven I'm very disappointed.

Rob: 45:02
I'm a little bit flat after that, if I'm honest.

Kev: 45:04
Oh dear, he's deflated. I thought he leaves deflated, dejected.

Rob: 45:08
I thought rock and chips would get yeah.

Kev: 45:10
No, rock rock and chips was easy. That one. I heard of it. I don't know why. But it was only fools and horses. So it it entered the cultural zeitgeist, somewhat like reservoir dogs did.

Rob: 45:20
So you you think reservoir dogs is more popular than rock and chips.

Kev: 45:24
I am willing to go out on a limb and say that more people will have heard of Reservoir Dogs than will have heard of rock and chips. Well, no comment. No comment required. Um thank you very much, Rob. Wow, I I'm supposed to have thought of what film to do next week.

Rob: 45:39
I can show you my Blu-ray database and then you can Yeah, but those are the ones you've heard of, aren't they?

Kev: 45:45
Yep. Um I think we're gonna go with minority report.

Rob: 45:52
Know anything about that? Um my immediate thoughts go to is there a plane involved? Don't think so. Okay, no then.

Kev: 46:04
I mean, I haven't rewatched it recently, so I'll go back and re-watch it. I don't remember a plane being particularly pivotal to the plane.

Rob: 46:10
Tom Cruise?

Kev: 46:11
Tom Cruise is in it, yes.

Rob: 46:14
So I know that much.

Kev: 46:15
Okay, so this is not completely new to you, but you're claiming all you know is Tom Cruise and possibly a plane, but almost certainly not.

Rob: 46:21
I've got a feeling I own this one as well.

Kev: 46:23
You own it or own it? Owned it. Owned it. Okay.

Rob: 46:25
I'd have to check my spreadsheet.

Kev: 46:26
It's a shame you don't own it, because I don't, and so I'm gonna have to try and dig it up from someone. I can borrow it off you. Um but no, I'm sure I can track it down. Um right, thank you very much, Rob. Um it's been a pleasure. I really enjoyed that, most of it. That's sort of. And we'll look forward to meeting again next week to discuss Minority Report. See you then. See you then. Right, thank you for joining us on this section of the podcast where we dive into last week's movie um and try and provide a little bit of a summary for anybody who either couldn't be bothered uh or has no intention of watching, which by the sounds of it again, maybe you.

Rob: 47:04
As I said, I did try. The opening sequence took so long, it was like just cinematic views of Boston with people's names in front of it. That that was enough, and it looked so of its time. So you you what you're actually talking about is the credits. But the yeah, the opening credits. I got to the first scene where they're in a little house somewhere in America and they go out the front door, and I was like, no, I can't do this. So I I was I think it was four minutes twenty in.

Kev: 47:33
Your patience is epically poor. I mean, you could have skipped it on a minute, or wasn't it? Okay. Alright, well, clearly you're never gonna watch it, even though I do still maintain you probably would enjoy it. Um so let's let's have a little recap of what actually happened. So in the film, Matt Damon is the eponymous character of Will Hunting. He is a genius, but he's really wasting his talent, is is the sort of main crux of the film. Um he spends his time with his three mates, Ben Affleck being one of them. I think Casey Affleck plays another one. That's Ben Affleck's brother, um, and then a fourth guy whose name I've already forgotten, unfortunately, but it's not really that important. Um so they spend their time drinking in bars, doing manual labour in the day, uh, and generally getting up to mischief. Anyway, when they're drinking in the bar one evening, they come across they see um Matt Damon's childhood bully, which you might remember from last week. I mean that I suggested we might try and introduce the childhood bully. Um, but there wasn't really a place for it. Um so they they see him and then on their way home or the next day or something, they see him again, uh, and they pull over in their car and they all run out and basically go and start a vicious brawl in the basketball courts. Police turn up because they just happen to be passing by as this big sort of fight is going on. Everybody else scarpers, but Matt Damon stays there punching uh the living daylights out of his childhood bully uh until he's dragged away by the police. Oh dear. So he's in big ominous. Yeah, he is pretty ominous. Should have mentioned about by this point, though, that he's actually working as a janitor at MIT.

Rob: 49:02
Okay.

Kev: 49:03
And at MIT they have there are these uh viciously difficult mathematical equations on a chalkboard that all of the math students have been challenged to try and solve.

Rob: 49:13
Oh, so he's gonna be able to solve it. Of course.

Kev: 49:15
So he's there janitoring away, sees the problem, can't immediately solve it, but he goes home and that night sort of starts writing mathematical equations on his mirror. You might remember that. Yeah, I remember that bit. Um so he sh he solves it on his mirror and then goes in the next day to work and writes it up on the board.

Rob: 49:30
Right, okay.

Kev: 49:32
Meanwhile, the professor, played by Stellan Skard, um sacks him for not cleaning and actually making more mess. Chases him down the corridor thinking he's thinks he's like defacing and uh you know scrawling all over his very important math board. But it turns out no, when he gets back to it, he realizes what?

Rob: 49:50
He has an epiphany, isn't he? He's only gone and solved it. Oh wow.

Kev: 49:53
He's only gone and solved it. So he realizes this guy is a genius. Anyway, by the time he's realised, Matt Damon is now in custody for having uh battered his childhood bully. So what should our professor do but go and make a deal with the judge that he will take young Matt Damon or Will Hunting under his wing, teach him the control of mathematics, um, and try and find him uh a really mental mastery of poster? Yeah, probably. Um wrote on it on the mirror. So all of that happens. Um so he's like being sponsored and taken under his wing, a little bit like your character was. If you think back to how you had your guy on the panel who was kind of his mentor. Meanwhile, he's also met um uh a girl, of course, Mini Driver. Grace? Not Grace, uh I think she's called Skylar from memory in the film, played by Mini Driver, um, who grows to love him. Poor old Will though, he he's got to keep people at a distance, he can't uh he can't open up to that sort of thing. Um part of the conditions of his kind of bail, I suppose, are that um he will go and meet with psychiatrists, so he goes and meets several and undermines all of them and makes them all quit by being particularly obtuse at all times.

Rob: 51:14
At this point, has he abandoned Ben Affleck and all his friends?

Kev: 51:16
No, no, no, he's still hanging out with them in bars every night and introducing Skylar to them and stuff like that. They're all getting on famously. Okay. Um until Robin Williams, the psychiatrist, takes over. And this is one of Robin Williams's very best performances, really is very good.

Rob: 51:29
Um better than Flubber.

Kev: 51:31
Almost certainly, but I've not seen it as we as we've discovered last week. He is a psychiatrist. He's a genius as well, who never never really fulfilled his potential in the eyes of others.

Rob: 51:42
Right, okay.

Kev: 51:43
But in his own eyes, he absolutely did because he's prepared, you know, he turned his back on his genius um to pursue what he wanted to do. He wanted to teach, um, he wanted to provide therapy for others, uh, and so he is spending his life exactly how he wants to. Who is content what everyone else thinks he's under achieved. Exactly so. And he was kind of best friends back in college with the mentor character, and he's one of the like the maths professor is one of the least likable characters in the entire thing because he he's all about success and stuff. There's a good bit where Matt Damon says, You got any idea how easy I find this? Uh which I think would cut him to his very core because he was like, Oh, this is difficult, I can't solve this, but you can. So, yeah, Robin Williams sort of does a little bit of psychiatric wizardry uh with him, and over the course of the film their bond grows, uh, and ultimately he manages to sort of fix Will up a little bit, make him realise that you know he's he can't keep pushing people away if he ever wants to be anything, can't keep uh rejecting all the opportunities and turning his back on his gift, which is obviously his genius, um, and that actually what what does he achieve by doing that? And he's sort of letting his friends down in the same in the same way by not making more of himself. Ben Affleck has a good bit where he says uh the best part of his morning is every morning walking up to that house and and hoping that when I knock on the door you've gone and you know you're not gonna be here. It's a bit bit harsh, I suppose, as a friend, but ultimately he's saying he doesn't want him hanging around to still be exactly he wants better for him. It it is a really good film, I think. Yeah, I can see what you mean about it being of its time, it looks dated, but it's it will stand that in terms of storytelling, narrative, script writing, acting, all of that stuff, it stands the test of time, but it does look like it was made in the in the mid-90s.

Rob: 53:21
It is because it was, but it's like it's grain grainy the the film when you're actually watching it.

Kev: 53:27
Yeah, yeah.

Rob: 53:28
Looks like it was hand-drawn, isn't that breakthrough film?

Kev: 53:32
I mean, it was it was made by a big studio, so it wasn't it wasn't a low budget film. There is a story that goes around about how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck chose the producer they wanted, which when they sent the script around, they added a completely random, um very graphic sex scene on pay on one of the pages about 70 pages in to see if any of the people who then said, Oh yeah, love your script, want to be a part of it, would actually mention it. And only only one producer said, What you know, what is this doing in here? And they went with that one because they're like, Well, you've actually read the script. Fair enough. So that's yeah, so we want to. Not the best one, just the one who's a risky play as well, isn't it? Like because even if they left it, they've read it and gone, okay. I liked it up to this point, but not for me from here. Oh no, I've gone the other way.

Rob: 54:21
They they love it and they leave it in. Yeah, well, you know, insist on it being in there.

Kev: 54:25
You've got to be in this. So I don't know whether that's true or not, but that is a cinematic canon, is that that's that's the case. Yeah. Um, but I think it's a really strong film, and if you haven't seen it, it is worth a watch, unlike Face Off. Which if you haven't seen it, I think you're probably winning it live.

Rob: 54:41
The problem is you go onto Netflix and you've got all these myriad of options, and it does look so dated, even just the the the tile that it is, like stranger things exist. Like that's that's the challenge.

Kev: 54:53
Yeah, well that's the same thing I suppose for all film and all old film in particular. Um, but there you go.

Rob: 54:58
That's them's the brakes. I'll uh I'll let you know if at any point I watch it.

Kev: 55:03
Okay, well you won't, obviously, so l let's not even bother. Um but yeah, well worth a watch. Get some high recommendation. Thanks very much.

Rob: 55:10
Bye bye.
