  "summary": "When a ruined Scottish castle is reopened for renovation, a wrecking ball accidentally unleashes the ghost of its last true king (and 400 years of flatulence). As the king's furious commands go viral and turn him into a global sensation, he mistakes attention for loyalty and begins to believe his kingdom has grown beyond Scotland itself. But when the world inevitably moves on, he is left trapped in the only place he ever ruled, still waiting for an audience that will never return.",
