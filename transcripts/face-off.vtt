1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.960
<v Kev>Hello and welcome to the
first episode of the No Context
Cinema 


2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.599
<v Kev>Club, a show where an almost
unbelievably unqualified person
rewrites


3
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:08.960
<v Kev>film history by creating
plots based only on titles and the
true,


4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Kev>though sometimes
disingenuous, clues that I provide
him about the


5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Kev>real films.


6
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.519
<v Kev>Each week we'll explore Rob's
complete ignorance of film history,


7
00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Kev>testing the limits of what is
possible to have missed from pop
culture


8
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Kev>during his 30-something years
on this planet, and hopefully having


9
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Kev>some fun along the way.


10
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Kev>There are two fundamental
rules.


11
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Kev>Firstly, he's not allowed to
research or Google anything as we
go,


12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Kev>and secondly, once he's
locked something in in his plot,
there are


13
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Kev>no takebacks.


14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.039
<v Kev>Will Rob's alternative cuts
be works of cinematic genius, or
simply


15
00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.039
<v Kev>descend into the insane
ramblings of a lunatic?


16
00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Kev>Only time will tell.


17
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.439
<v Kev>At the end of each episode,
I'll score Rob's efforts in three
areas


18
00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Kev>coherence, entertainment
factor, and originality.


19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Kev>For our first episode, we'll
be diving headlong into the 90s
action


20
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.399
<v Kev>classic, FaceOff.


21
00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.759
<v Kev>So Rob, would you like to
introduce yourself and tell us a
little


22
00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:53.119
<v Kev>bit about the origins of this
podcast?


24
00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:54.159
<v Rob>Yes.


25
00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.719
<v Rob>So a while back you uh
mentioned a film called FaceOff,
which we're


26
00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Rob>going to talk about today.


27
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Rob>Um and you were humoured by
my initial thoughts about what the
film


28
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.159
<v Rob>was.


29
00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Rob>Um obviously I was incorrect
with my initial thoughts, and then 


30
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Rob>you obviously wanted me to
come onto a podcast with you so you
could


31
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Rob>mock me generally about my
film knowledge.


33
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Kev>Which is a very valuable and
insightful idea for the world of
podcasting.


34
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Kev>Pretty much, yeah.


35
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.799
<v Kev>In our first section, which
we'll be calling plot luck, Rob has 


36
00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Kev>nothing but the title to work
with.


37
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.560
<v Kev>So let's see what his initial
guesswork tells us about the new
director's


38
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.599
<v Kev>cut of faceoff.


39
00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:32.239
<v Kev>So have you had any initial
thoughts on what face off might be
since


40
00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Kev>you first pitched what you
assumed it was?


42
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Rob>So I I obviously know that my
original thought wasn't quite there.


43
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.319
<v Rob>So I've I've been thinking
about what face-off could be.


44
00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.319
<v Rob>I've got two thoughts about
what it could be.


45
00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Rob>Uh the first one, uh, which
was my initial reaction, was based
on


46
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Rob>my knowledge of your love for
ice hockey.


47
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Rob>So when you mentioned face
off, my initial thought was that it
was


48
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.959
<v Rob>an ice hockey-based film.


49
00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Rob>You laughed quite a lot about
that.


50
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Rob>So then my second thought was
that it was some sort of film where


51
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.439
<v Rob>a character loses their face,
referencing uh the office, Dwight 


52
00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Rob>Shroots, has a face peeled
off and then put onto his face at
one


53
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.960
<v Rob>point.


55
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.360
<v Kev>I am familiar with the
episode in which that happens.


56
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.879
<v Kev>That I think is more of a
reference to a film than a reference
from


57
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:15.280
<v Kev>the office.


58
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.319
<v Kev>But we'll let that no, we'll
let's explore that for a second.


59
00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.319
<v Kev>So Dwight takes the face off
the Rosussi dummy, doesn't he?


60
00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.639
<v Kev>Yep.


61
00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.159
<v Kev>In the episode, and then says
he always wonders how realistic it


62
00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:26.639
<v Kev>is to do that.


63
00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.680
<v Kev>I think that's probably
referencing the silence of the lambs
with


64
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.479
<v Kev>Anthony Hopkins, but it's
also possibly a reference to the
Texas


65
00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.639
<v Kev>Chainsaw Massacre, I suppose,
because there's a character called


66
00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.639
<v Kev>Leatherface in that who takes
a face off.


67
00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Kev>So either way, I mean I'm
happy with that.


69
00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.599
<v Rob>Um I'm referencing a TV show,
which is referencing a film which 


70
00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Rob>I'm unaware of.


72
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.840
<v Kev>That is brilliant, I would
say a fair, fair summary of the
situation,


73
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Kev>yes.


74
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Kev>Yep.


75
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.759
<v Kev>Okay, right.


76
00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.319
<v Kev>So which of those avenues
shall we exploit?


77
00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Kev>To be honest, because it was
your first thought, I think even
though


78
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.520
<v Kev>we subsequently know it's not
correct, I'd quite like to follow 


79
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.719
<v Kev>the ice hockey theme if you
were happy, but we can we can go
with


80
00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.439
<v Kev>the take taking a face off a
person if you prefer.


82
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.199
<v Rob>I I feel like I've fleshed
out the ice hockey film more in my
mind,


83
00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.120
<v Rob>and obviously it was only an
immediate reaction.


84
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Rob>And I I reckon I reckon
there's a film there that we could
talk 


85
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Rob>about, even if it doesn't
exist.


87
00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.039
<v Kev>Okay, well, it doesn't exist.


88
00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.520
<v Kev>Um let's do this.


89
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.759
<v Kev>Okay, so the film in in which
we're working on here is going to 


90
00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.960
<v Kev>be an ice hockey-based film.


91
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.080
<v Kev>Have you got any thoughts
about the plot other than it's about
ice


92
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.400
<v Kev>hockey?


94
00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.599
<v Rob>Well, all films that are
about sport have a very similar
story arc,


95
00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.400
<v Rob>and that is that there is
some sort of crisis, whether it's a
a 


96
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.080
<v Rob>school or a club in crisis or
an individual in crisis, and then 


97
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.400
<v Rob>it's basically just
redemption arc from there.


98
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.080
<v Rob>So I think overall it's going
to be a redemption story, but it's


99
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Rob>a redemption story for an
individual.


101
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.240
<v Kev>Okay.


102
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.159
<v Kev>Uh have you got any thoughts
on the individual, the protagonist 


103
00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Kev>of this particular story?


105
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.360
<v Rob>Yep, I don't know the actor's
name.


106
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Rob>Oh, yeah, okay.


107
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Rob>So what we will find over the
course of this podcast is that I
also


108
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Rob>don't know many many actors
and what they're in.


109
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.439
<v Rob>I've got a weird word
association when it comes to film
and actors


110
00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.919
<v Rob>that I just think of random
things and then or I associate them 


111
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.919
<v Rob>with random things, and
that's what I'll refer to.


112
00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.199
<v Rob>So the actor, I've got I've
got a lead actor for the film.


113
00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Rob>I don't know his name, so
you're gonna have to help me with
that.


114
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.480
<v Rob>I'll try.


115
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.000
<v Rob>He is the guy that is in
Jurassic Park with is the bigger guy
that


116
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.920
<v Rob>wears a yellow jacket in the
rain.


118
00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:29.439
<v Kev>Oh, out in the rain, okay.


119
00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:31.920
<v Kev>Yeah, he's the guy that uh
ends up getting eaten on the toilet.


120
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.439
<v Kev>Does he?


121
00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.800
<v Kev>He I think he does.


122
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.040
<v Kev>I mean, I haven't seen
Jurassic Park for a while, but I'm
fairly


123
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Kev>sure.


124
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.600
<v Kev>So the guy, I know who you're
talking about.


125
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.839
<v Kev>Um, and he is a guy, he was
in Seinfeld, I think, and a comedy
called


126
00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:45.759
<v Kev>Third Rock from the Sun as
Officer Don.


127
00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Kev>But anyway, go on.


128
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.319
<v Kev>He's he's also in Cool
Runnings.


129
00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.199
<v Kev>He okay, he's not also in
Cool Runnings.


131
00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Rob>He is, is is the coach in
Cool Runnings?


133
00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Kev>Uh that's John Candy, who is
another fat guy.


134
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Kev>Ah, right.


135
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Kev>Okay.


137
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.480
<v Rob>So I've mixed up my uh my
Hollywood fat guys.


139
00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Kev>I I think you might have.


140
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.920
<v Kev>Okay, right, but so John so
John Candy in Cool Runnings, which
is


141
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.519
<v Kev>a sport film which features a
redemption arc for the main
character.


142
00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:17.279
<v Kev>I can see where this has uh
sort of crept into your
consciousness


143
00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Kev>because yeah, John Candy in
that film in Cool Runnings is a
disgraced


144
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Kev>Bob Slay coach who cheated
when he himself was in the Winter
Olympics.


146
00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:26.319
<v Rob>Right.


147
00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.439
<v Rob>So something that we should
worry about is that my ice hockey
film


148
00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.399
<v Rob>is pretty much that.


150
00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:34.079
<v Kev>Well, I mean, there's similar
there's ice, uh there's a
redemption.


151
00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:36.480
<v Kev>There's not even ice for the
character.


152
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.639
<v Kev>But I but I you know I think
we can work with this.


153
00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.319
<v Kev>I mean, in face off, you want
John you want either John Candy or


154
00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.680
<v Kev>offers a don from Third Rock
from the Sun who also uh gets wears


155
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.360
<v Kev>a big yellow jacket in the
rain in Jackson.


157
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Rob>I'm sure I'm sure the guy in
uh in Colour Runnings wears a yellow


158
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.560
<v Rob>jacket.


159
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.199
<v Rob>I know he wears a big duffel.


161
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Kev>In okay.


162
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.279
<v Kev>Have you watched Home Alone
recently, Rob?


163
00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:00.480
<v Kev>Yep, love Home Alone.


164
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.959
<v Kev>Okay.


165
00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:04.879
<v Kev>I think John Candy wears a
yellow jacket in his short cameo
appearance


166
00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.079
<v Kev>in Home Alone when he is, was
he, uh I can't remember the name of


167
00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:09.360
<v Kev>it, but he goes, Polka,
polka, polka.


168
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.240
<v Kev>He's the polka singer.


169
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.079
<v Kev>The back of the van.


170
00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Kev>I think they all wear yellow
jackets, don't they?


171
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.480
<v Kev>Um his polka outfit who was
trying to get back to Milwaukee or
something


172
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.720
<v Kev>like that.


174
00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.879
<v Rob>Is the guy in the back of the
van the guy from Jurassic Park or 


175
00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:23.199
<v Rob>Cool Runnings?


177
00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:24.000
<v Kev>Cool Runnings.


178
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.439
<v Kev>That's John Candy in both.


180
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Rob>So you want him.


182
00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Kev>He is my main man.


183
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.279
<v Kev>Sorry, guy from Third Rock
from the Sun, and I think Seinfeld,
and


184
00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Kev>I don't know your name, I'm
afraid, but John Candy has just
beaten


185
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.879
<v Kev>you to it in the final
casting to be the protagonist of
Rob's new


186
00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:37.600
<v Kev>film Face Off.


187
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.079
<v Kev>But don't worry, John Candy
will be very used to the role
because


188
00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:42.639
<v Kev>he's played it already in
Cool Runnings by the sound of it.


189
00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.319
<v Kev>Although he was much more
alive when that was made than he is
currently.


191
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Rob>Immediate casting issues.


192
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.639
<v Rob>Yeah, yes.


193
00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.319
<v Rob>What I will say is I I was
thinking coming into this that my
film


194
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.399
<v Rob>knowledge was below average,
but my TV knowledge was better than


195
00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:56.560
<v Rob>average.


196
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.040
<v Rob>Okay.


197
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:04.480
<v Rob>So my um my references are
gonna be poor at this point, I
think.


199
00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Kev>Well, I mean let's explore.


200
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.199
<v Kev>So we've got John Candy
playing the role of what?


202
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.879
<v Rob>Uh obviously based in
America.


204
00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:14.319
<v Kev>Of course, if it's well, or
Canada maybe if it's I mean, John
Candy


205
00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.279
<v Kev>was Canadian, I believe.


206
00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:16.319
<v Kev>So you know, you could be
Canadian.


207
00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Kev>No, America.


208
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.319
<v Kev>We're going to Hollywood,
yeah.


210
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.639
<v Rob>We're going, yeah, we're
going to the big screen, so we're at
Hollywood,


211
00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:21.279
<v Rob>why not?


212
00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:22.480
<v Rob>He's some sort of teacher.


213
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.040
<v Rob>Okay.


214
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.160
<v Rob>I don't know if he's lower
school or middle school.


215
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.639
<v Rob>I don't know what they call
lower school over in the States.


217
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:29.439
<v Kev>I don't know.


218
00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:30.319
<v Kev>Elementary, is it?


219
00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:33.279
<v Kev>Elementary, but they're
probably too young to be doing much
ice 


220
00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:34.720
<v Kev>hockey stuff with a
redemption arc.


222
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Rob>He is a coach at a middle
school ice hockey team.


223
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.680
<v Rob>And here's the twist: he used
to be big time.


225
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.399
<v Kev>Did he?


226
00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.199
<v Kev>He used to be big time.


227
00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.000
<v Kev>He used to be big time.


228
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.279
<v Kev>Did he skate in the Olympics?


229
00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:51.439
<v Kev>Like he did in Garchomp.


231
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Rob>I'm assuming that's a
reference to Gorin's.


232
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Rob>No, he didn't used to.


233
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.199
<v Rob>He was on the verge of
becoming um uh a National Hockey
League coach.


235
00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:02.079
<v Kev>Was he?


236
00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:02.399
<v Kev>Yep.


237
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.040
<v Kev>So he was on the on the cusp
of NHL stardom.


238
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.040
<v Kev>As a coach, not as a player.


240
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.639
<v Rob>Uh yeah, as a coach, he's a
big guy.


241
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.399
<v Rob>He's not gonna be an amazing
hockey player.


243
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.759
<v Kev>Okay, well he could have been
a goon.


244
00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Kev>You know, he could have been
a guy on skates who just goes out to


245
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.040
<v Kev>pummel people.


247
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.160
<v Rob>Yeah, I like I like that.


248
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.279
<v Rob>No, no, he's not that.


249
00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:21.519
<v Rob>He's he was on the verge of
becoming a successful NHL coach.


251
00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:25.680
<v Kev>Okay, right, and now he finds
himself in high school or middle
school,


252
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.319
<v Kev>whatever you said.


254
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.959
<v Rob>Yeah, yeah, but not in a
school that's in Canada.


255
00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:29.920
<v Rob>I don't want that.


256
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.519
<v Rob>I don't want him in a cold
state.


257
00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:34.320
<v Rob>Okay, he is in a warm state.


258
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.879
<v Rob>He's in I want to say
Florida.


259
00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:42.720
<v Rob>Okay, yeah, that's maybe
wearing a nice uh nice sort of uh um
palm


260
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.399
<v Rob>tree shirt to the games.


261
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.480
<v Rob>Okay, so he's he's wearing
his sort of flamboyant some
somewhere


262
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.759
<v Rob>not known for the hockey.


263
00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:52.960
<v Rob>Okay, well, I mean the
Florida Panthers won the Stanley Cup
very


264
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Rob>recently.


265
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.919
<v Rob>So this is the problem that
your knowledge of hockey is better
than


266
00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:58.159
<v Rob>mine as well, so it's gonna
follow me here.


267
00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:00.639
<v Rob>So somewhere where it's got
him in New Mexico.


268
00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Rob>Perfect.


270
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.320
<v Kev>Lovely.


271
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Kev>He's in New Mexico.


273
00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:05.360
<v Rob>Is there a desert in New
Mexico or that's the case?


275
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Kev>I think it's basically a
giant desert, really.


276
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.679
<v Kev>I think New Mexico.


277
00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:10.000
<v Kev>It's where Breaking Bad was
set, if you've ever heard of that.


279
00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:12.399
<v Rob>I've heard of it, I've
watched some of it.


280
00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:16.000
<v Rob>Again, I thought my TV
knowledge was better than my
knowledge, but


281
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.440
<v Rob>maybe I'm incorrect on that
one.


282
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Rob>It is somewhere I I feel a
bit deserty, a bit Arizona, maybe
somewhere


283
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.000
<v Rob>around Phoenix.


285
00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.279
<v Kev>Alright, we're going for
Phoenix.


286
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:25.519
<v Kev>I think they just lost their
hockey team.


287
00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:28.639
<v Kev>Uh they got re-uh, don't
forget, re-franchised somewhere.


288
00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:31.519
<v Kev>I went to Utah, I think,
another desert, but this is middle
school.


289
00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:33.039
<v Kev>Okay, yeah, that's true.


291
00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:35.200
<v Rob>This isn't Hockey League,
this is middle school.


293
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.519
<v Kev>Okay, but the youngsters
could be devastated that their NHL
team,


294
00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Kev>their local NHL team have
just left, and that was their
pathway 


295
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:42.559
<v Kev>to success.


297
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.080
<v Rob>This is based in the same
year that Space Jam was I've no idea
what


298
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.039
<v Rob>it was when there was.


300
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.519
<v Kev>I don't know.


301
00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:53.440
<v Kev>I mean the Space Jam feels
like a late, no, maybe a mid-90s
film


302
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:53.759
<v Kev>to me.


304
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.320
<v Rob>Maybe the reason being is
Space Jam.


305
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Rob>I remember in the serial you
used to get the little toys and the


306
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.080
<v Rob>Space Jam toys.


307
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.399
<v Rob>Right.


308
00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.840
<v Rob>There's gonna be toys for
this film.


309
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.240
<v Rob>There's gonna be toys in the
series and some merchandise.


310
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.759
<v Rob>Little hockey pucks.


312
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.039
<v Kev>Little pucks with the team,
whatever they're gonna be.


313
00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:09.759
<v Kev>Yeah, the New Mexico.


314
00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:12.320
<v Kev>Yeah, we'll probably focus on
the team next rather than the
freebies


315
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.360
<v Kev>that are given out.


316
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.080
<v Kev>Okay, right.


317
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.159
<v Kev>So he's coaching in New
Mexico.


318
00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:17.039
<v Kev>Yep.


319
00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:20.720
<v Kev>Okay, what has I mean, what
has been this terrible thing that he


320
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.519
<v Kev>needs redemption from?


322
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.480
<v Rob>Not sure yet.


323
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.039
<v Rob>Okay, he's definitely done
something which has shamed himself,
and


324
00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:31.360
<v Rob>he's essentially on the run
in hiding, and he's not been able to


325
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.759
<v Rob>take his his amazing job up
at the NHL, and he's he's had to go 


326
00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:38.960
<v Rob>and the only job he can get
is uh a really down on its look
middle


327
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.399
<v Rob>school hockey team in
Arizona.


328
00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.399
<v Rob>Okay, a ragtag bunch of
misfits.


329
00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:45.759
<v Rob>Yeah, nobody wants to play
hockey, they're all they're all out
enjoying


330
00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:46.960
<v Rob>the the desert, I suppose.


331
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.159
<v Rob>Doing whatever you do in the
desert, chasing cactuses or
something.


333
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.799
<v Kev>But famously difficult to
catch.


335
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.879
<v Rob>He doesn't want to be there,
and the hockey team.


336
00:10:56.879 --> 00:11:00.399
<v Rob>I've got a vague reference of
something I've seen on TikTok where


337
00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:04.000
<v Rob>a basketball coach goes and
he causes a bit of trouble at the
school


338
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.679
<v Rob>he goes to, it's a
high-flying basketball team, and he
he comes 


339
00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:11.039
<v Rob>and messes things up by
requiring certain grade point
averages and


340
00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:11.360
<v Rob>stuff like that.


341
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.720
<v Rob>He's a little bit like that.


343
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.320
<v Kev>That is Coach Carter.


344
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.120
<v Kev>I think you're probably
referencing there with Samuel L.


345
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.440
<v Kev>Jackson as as the as the main
coach who won't accept any ill
discipline


346
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.960
<v Kev>from his from his team.


348
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:23.919
<v Rob>Is Samuel L.


349
00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:25.039
<v Rob>Jackson bold in the film?


351
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:26.720
<v Kev>He I believe Samuel L.


352
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.600
<v Kev>Jackson is bold in every film
and life.


353
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.799
<v Kev>In that case, it might be
okay.


354
00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:36.720
<v Kev>Right, so what was what was
his crime?


355
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.240
<v Kev>Was there a crime?


357
00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:39.440
<v Rob>Yeah, fraud, obviously.


359
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.559
<v Kev>Fraud, okay.


361
00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:42.320
<v Rob>Defrauded the hockey team.


362
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.879
<v Rob>Um I don't know, he was
dodging his taxes.


363
00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:46.879
<v Rob>Dodging his taxes, okay.


364
00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Rob>No, probably shouldn't on the
first episode alienate all
Americans.


365
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.240
<v Rob>No.


366
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Rob>Um, he is dodging some sort
of taxes or fraud, um, and he's been


367
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.799
<v Rob>dragged into a he's he's a
nice guy, but he has been found to
be


368
00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:03.759
<v Rob>guilty for this.


370
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.960
<v Kev>Okay, and now he finds
himself down on his luck in the
middle of


371
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.679
<v Kev>the desert, trying to coach a
ragtag bunch of misfits who have no


372
00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:10.639
<v Kev>interest in playing ice
hockey.


373
00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:11.679
<v Kev>That's what we're going with.


375
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:11.840
<v Rob>Yep.


377
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.200
<v Kev>In our next section called
The Plot Thickens, I'll be feeding
Rob


378
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.480
<v Kev>some more information about
the real film face-off, um, which
he's


379
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.000
<v Kev>going to be forced to include
within his own already slightly
derivative


380
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.639
<v Kev>plot.


381
00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.000
<v Kev>So here we go.


382
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Kev>The first thing I've got for
you, Rob, is that in the real film 


383
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.600
<v Kev>face-off, the hero does
assume a new identity.


385
00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:33.039
<v Rob>Right, okay.


386
00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:39.279
<v Rob>So my main character who is
played by John Candy.


387
00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.240
<v Rob>By John Candy.


388
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Rob>Uh it's a coincidence that
because he's called John in the film


389
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.200
<v Rob>as well.


391
00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:43.679
<v Kev>That's helpful.


392
00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.240
<v Kev>That's what I'm saying.


394
00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:47.360
<v Rob>He's called John in the film
now, but he wasn't when the film
first


395
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:47.600
<v Rob>started.


397
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.679
<v Kev>So because he's got to assume
a new identity.


398
00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:50.480
<v Kev>Correct.


400
00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:54.159
<v Rob>So um what I didn't say in
the first section was that actually
that


401
00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:57.039
<v Rob>it's quite a bit of court
case he's going through, and as part
of


402
00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.159
<v Rob>that, he's under a bit of
pressure.


403
00:12:58.159 --> 00:13:03.840
<v Rob>So part of his move to uh
Phoenix, Arizona, um is part of the
witness


404
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.960
<v Rob>protection programme,
actually.


405
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.120
<v Rob>So he's taken up a totally
new life.


406
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.639
<v Rob>So he's obviously working
through his skill sets that he's
got, 


407
00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:14.240
<v Rob>but um, he has left his whole
life behind and he's now called
John.


409
00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:15.600
<v Kev>Now called John.


410
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.960
<v Kev>Right, we don't know what he
was called before.


411
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.480
<v Kev>That's okay, we don't need to
worry about that.


412
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.279
<v Kev>He's in witness protection.


413
00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:21.600
<v Kev>Why would we know what he was
called before?


414
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.080
<v Kev>Right.


415
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Kev>Uh can I just clarify, we're
in Phoenix, Arizona, aren't we?


416
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.320
<v Kev>I said New Mexico earlier.


417
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.200
<v Kev>You weren't happy with that.


418
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Kev>No, we moved him to Phoenix,
Arizona, that's all good.


420
00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:32.799
<v Rob>I I know more about Phoenix
because I once flew out of there, so


421
00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:35.519
<v Rob>that feels like it should be
that, and it's definitely hot.


423
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Kev>It is very hot in Phoenix,
Arizona.


424
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.399
<v Kev>Okay, perfect.


425
00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:40.799
<v Kev>So John is now in Phoenix,
Arizona.


426
00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:47.679
<v Kev>He's under witness protection
for some sort of financial
fraud-based


427
00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:50.480
<v Kev>activities in his previous
life.


429
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Rob>Something to do with the NHL.


431
00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:55.039
<v Kev>Something to do, oh okay,
right.


432
00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:57.679
<v Kev>So it's a potentially a big
story, is it?


434
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Rob>Yeah, so do you remember back
in the 90s when Premier League
managers


435
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.279
<v Rob>were accused of tapping up
players?


436
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.240
<v Rob>Oh, yes, of course.


437
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.120
<v Rob>He was doing that, but with
sponsors and he was taking
kickbacks.


438
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.919
<v Rob>He was he was found guilty of
taking kickbacks, but there was a 


439
00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:14.240
<v Rob>lot of money involved, and
people went missing.


440
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.840
<v Rob>It got a little bit a little
bit dirty, a little bit nasty, and 


441
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.200
<v Rob>that's when he was uh
relocated.


442
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.080
<v Rob>Hang about.


443
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.120
<v Rob>Can you guys can you guilty?


444
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.159
<v Rob>Why is he in witness
protection?


445
00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:23.679
<v Rob>Can you be guilty of the
city?


446
00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:24.960
<v Rob>Why is he in witness
protection then?


447
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.960
<v Rob>If he's already been found
guilty of this crime?


448
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.639
<v Rob>Sorry, there's an ongoing
trial.


449
00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:29.919
<v Rob>Sorry, there's an ongoing
trial.


450
00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:30.799
<v Rob>He's presumed guilty.


451
00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:31.440
<v Rob>You misspoke.


452
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.320
<v Rob>Misspoke, yeah.


453
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Rob>Like he probably did in
court, I imagine.


454
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.279
<v Rob>He's a nervous guy.


455
00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:41.679
<v Rob>Um he is under a trial and
there's risk to his life, and for
that


456
00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:45.279
<v Rob>reason he's in witness
protection while under suspicion.


458
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.960
<v Kev>Well, under suspicion, so
maybe he's done it, maybe he hasn't.


459
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Kev>Yeah, but we all know he's
guilty.


460
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.679
<v Kev>Okay, we know he's alright,
fine.


461
00:14:51.679 --> 00:14:54.960
<v Kev>It's it's clear in his arc
that he has to so far, yeah.


462
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.759
<v Kev>Okay, alright.


463
00:14:55.759 --> 00:15:00.240
<v Kev>So that explains why uh the
hero gets a new identity.


464
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.360
<v Kev>That's good.


465
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.919
<v Kev>Um I've got a quote from uh
face off that I picked up when I
rewatched


466
00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:07.600
<v Kev>it last week for this.


467
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:13.759
<v Kev>Um in this he actually says
when all else fails, fresh tactics.


469
00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:15.519
<v Rob>Perfect.


470
00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:18.720
<v Rob>And this fits right into the
rest of the film.


471
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.279
<v Rob>Because what we've not talked
about is actually his day-to-day job


472
00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:23.679
<v Rob>in Phoenix or or what he does
on a day-to-day basis.


473
00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:28.559
<v Rob>He's obviously gone to this
middle school and he's started to
coach


474
00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:29.840
<v Rob>them ice hockey.


475
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Rob>They're not very keen on it,
obviously, they're in the middle of


476
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.080
<v Rob>a desert, they don't have an
ice hockey rink, he has to do
fundraisers.


477
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.000
<v Rob>I'm I'm thinking this too as
I'm talking about.


478
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.240
<v Rob>They don't have a ring, he
has to do fundraisers.


479
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.080
<v Rob>How have they given him a
job?


480
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.519
<v Rob>Why have they taken him on as
a coach?


481
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:49.200
<v Rob>They're a high school who've
just got funding for an ice hockey 


482
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:55.519
<v Rob>team, and he has to go and
help raise more funds to build a
rink


483
00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:58.799
<v Rob>and start the program kit and
all that.


484
00:15:58.799 --> 00:16:01.840
<v Rob>So he has to get the kids on
board, he has to convince the school


485
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.559
<v Rob>they need to go bigger and
better, the parents can't be
bothered.


486
00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:05.279
<v Rob>Wow.


487
00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.120
<v Rob>That's where his starting
point was.


488
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.279
<v Rob>But he's actually a really
good coach.


490
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.320
<v Kev>Okay, right.


491
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.600
<v Kev>So he is a genuinely good
coach.


493
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.480
<v Rob>Yeah, he's a genuinely good
coach, which is why he was targeted 


494
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.159
<v Rob>targeted by the blinking
thieves earlier.


496
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:22.960
<v Kev>So for the benefit of the
listeners, uh Rob just sort of shook
his


497
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.639
<v Kev>fist in a in a in a very
dramatic way that sadly was will
never 


498
00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:27.919
<v Kev>be caught on the podcast
itself.


500
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.320
<v Rob>But he he's obviously very
clued up and he gets the team
playing


501
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.279
<v Rob>quite well.


502
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:38.000
<v Rob>Um and he's got a bit of a
love interest that's that he meets
one


503
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.120
<v Rob>of the teachers maybe there.


504
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.519
<v Rob>Okay.


505
00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:42.399
<v Rob>Um, and you can see there's a
bit of a relationship blossoming
between


506
00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:42.720
<v Rob>the two.


507
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.679
<v Rob>Um he's bringing these.


509
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.039
<v Kev>He's not gonna let that he's
not gonna let her down, is he?


511
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.039
<v Rob>Well, he's a nice guy, Kevin.


512
00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:50.000
<v Rob>He's doing really well.


513
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.440
<v Rob>He's he's brought the
community together.


514
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.080
<v Rob>You they've gone from having
nothing to that they can't wait for


515
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.759
<v Rob>Thursday night when they play
ice hockey.


517
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.960
<v Kev>Okay, but I sort of feel like
in these sorts of films, and you
don't


518
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.759
<v Kev>have to go with this because
it's your movie, in these sorts of 


519
00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:07.759
<v Kev>films, there's often a point
where he has to, I don't know,
balance


520
00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:12.559
<v Kev>the interests of the team or
himself versus the the burgeoning
love


521
00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:12.799
<v Kev>interest.


523
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.160
<v Rob>Oh yeah, there's because
she's only free on Thursday nights.


525
00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:17.759
<v Kev>Okay.


526
00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:19.519
<v Kev>Did I imagine she she worked?


527
00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:22.559
<v Kev>But but he is starting the
programme, so arguably he could just


528
00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:23.359
<v Kev>move the tank.


530
00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.480
<v Rob>There's availability of the
other teams and whatever, and it's
Thursday


531
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.839
<v Rob>night league hockey night.


532
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.319
<v Rob>Of course.


534
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.680
<v Kev>And obviously she And it's
the only it's the only day that the
as


535
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.039
<v Kev>yet unbuilt rink is free.


537
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.839
<v Rob>Yeah, it's very, very, very
busy.


538
00:17:35.839 --> 00:17:39.920
<v Rob>Uh, but also uh her son is on
the hockey team.


539
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.000
<v Rob>Oh damn, he is not very good.


540
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.039
<v Rob>Oh, he he was first round of
like the the call he was dropped.


542
00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:49.599
<v Kev>Right, well we're we're
fleshing out the story quite nicely.


543
00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Kev>Yeah, I would like you to
explain why the movie starts with a
very


544
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.599
<v Kev>lengthy sort of 15-minute
runway chase and shootout, if you
could.


546
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.519
<v Rob>Yeah, obviously.


547
00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:05.759
<v Rob>It's quite the curved part.


549
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.799
<v Kev>A 15-minute review.


550
00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:11.119
<v Kev>Yeah, it's it's a it lasts
about 15 minutes.


551
00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:14.160
<v Kev>I mean, probably the runway
part is about 10 minutes and then
there's


552
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Kev>five minutes.


554
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.480
<v Rob>You you need to rewatch the
film, Kev, because I that doesn't
happen


555
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.200
<v Rob>in this version of FaceOff.


556
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.000
<v Rob>That's fine.


557
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.920
<v Rob>I have it doesn't happen in
this version.


558
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.920
<v Rob>It does happen in this
version of FaceOff, actually.


559
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:29.920
<v Rob>I don't know if you've seen
the um opening to Toy Story 2, I
believe.


561
00:18:31.119 --> 00:18:35.119
<v Kev>That's the one with the
prospector guy, the smelly
prospector guy


562
00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:35.759
<v Kev>train.


564
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.519
<v Rob>Maybe so the opening scene of
FaceOff, I nearly forgot the name 


565
00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:41.599
<v Rob>of the screen.


566
00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:50.480
<v Rob>Is a very dramatic
reenactment of a plane landing and a
gunfight


567
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Rob>around the plane, but it's
actually John and his love interest
son


568
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.839
<v Rob>playing with his toys.


569
00:18:57.839 --> 00:18:59.839
<v Rob>So we kind of meet them
midway.


571
00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:04.880
<v Kev>I now I remember the the
story or the part of Toy Story 2
that you're


572
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.519
<v Kev>referencing now.


573
00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:07.599
<v Kev>It might be Toy Story 2, it
might be Toy Story 3.


574
00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:10.559
<v Kev>Um if you need any more film,
just let me know.


575
00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:13.200
<v Kev>It all goes back there in
there.


576
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.440
<v Kev>That's right, it's quite an
elaborate opening sequence, and then


577
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Kev>it turns out it's just um
Andy or something playing with his
toys.


578
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.960
<v Kev>Right.


579
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.039
<v Kev>So the next the next part of
information I've got for you um is 


580
00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:24.880
<v Kev>going to involve a relatively
lengthy impression.


581
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.759
<v Kev>And I'd just like to point
out now that I'm doing an impression


582
00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:31.920
<v Kev>as a stylistic or kind of
artistic choice, and it's in no way
related


583
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.119
<v Kev>to uh a basic lack of
understanding of intellectual
property law.


585
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Rob>Um I've genuinely never been
this excited.


587
00:19:38.319 --> 00:19:39.359
<v Kev>I didn't know we were doing
impression.


588
00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:41.039
<v Kev>Well, I mean, get ready.


589
00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:45.039
<v Kev>Um I would like to point out
so in actuality, and I I'm not gonna


590
00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:47.200
<v Kev>say too much about the actual
film of Face Off, but it is possibly


591
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.880
<v Kev>one of the most outrageously
overacted movies that I have ever
seen.


592
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.759
<v Kev>You might have seen The Mask,
surely you've seen the mask with Jim


593
00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:53.920
<v Kev>Carrey.


594
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.480
<v Kev>Yeah.


595
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:54.880
<v Kev>Okay.


596
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.359
<v Kev>In that, he's very
deliberately overacting, yeah?


597
00:19:57.359 --> 00:19:57.680
<v Kev>Yeah.


598
00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.799
<v Kev>So in this, they're just
acting like that.


599
00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:05.039
<v Kev>Uh but anyway, so I've got a
quote for you, and I think I think 


600
00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:07.599
<v Kev>we were able to easily and
seamlessly fit in this in, but here
we


601
00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:07.759
<v Kev>go.


603
00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:14.559
<v Kev>You're asking me to break the
law, risk my neck, and you're asking


604
00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:19.039
<v Kev>me to put in the dark all the
people that love me and trust me.


605
00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:21.359
<v Kev>I'll do it.


606
00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:23.119
<v Kev>Uh, where does that fit into
the film?


607
00:20:23.119 --> 00:20:28.400
<v Kev>Firstly, I am flawed by that
act, which is great.


609
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.440
<v Kev>Well, thank you.


611
00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:33.119
<v Rob>I mean, I th I think this is
pretty obvious where it fits into
the


612
00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:33.359
<v Rob>film.


613
00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:38.480
<v Rob>It's um it obviously calls
back to the initial court case
that's


614
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.839
<v Rob>going on, and obviously we
know he's got a new love interest,
but


615
00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:45.920
<v Rob>he has left loved ones
behind, not necessarily a partner,
but he


616
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.920
<v Rob>has left friends and family
and and ex-colleagues, and they're
obviously


617
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.559
<v Rob>embroiled in some of their
fraudulent issues that he's facing
um


618
00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:56.160
<v Rob>that cost him his job in the
NHL.


620
00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:57.119
<v Kev>Yeah, okay.


621
00:20:57.119 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Kev>Well, I mean, and once again,
I'm just gonna dive back to the
original


622
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.960
<v Kev>face-off because this really
stood out for me, that quote, um,
just


623
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.359
<v Kev>with a pure, complete level
of selfishness, where he only talks 


624
00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:09.839
<v Kev>about all the people that
love me and trust me, and he doesn't
make


625
00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:11.759
<v Kev>any reference to his own
feelings about them whatsoever.


626
00:21:11.759 --> 00:21:14.559
<v Kev>It's all about oh, you're
asking me to do this to the people
who


627
00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:15.119
<v Kev>love me.


628
00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:17.599
<v Kev>Um, not to the people he
loves, but the people who love him.


629
00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:19.839
<v Kev>So he's I think he's got a
slightly selfish side.


630
00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:22.240
<v Kev>Um, how do we square that
circle?


632
00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:25.759
<v Rob>I I think your painting,
John, is quite a one-dimensional
character


633
00:21:25.759 --> 00:21:26.160
<v Rob>there.


634
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Rob>I think actually the move,
the big the move to the big city, to


635
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.319
<v Rob>the movement to Phoenix, has
actually brought out a softer side,


636
00:21:32.319 --> 00:21:34.240
<v Rob>and he's actually more of a
community man.


637
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.400
<v Rob>So he's obviously learnt his
lesson from uh his his past trials,


638
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.279
<v Rob>I'd imagine.


640
00:21:39.839 --> 00:21:40.319
<v Kev>Okay, all right.


641
00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:41.599
<v Kev>Well, I mean it it fits.


642
00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:44.799
<v Kev>So we've managed to put in
some genuine details from FaceOp
into


643
00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:46.000
<v Kev>your film almost seamlessly.


644
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.920
<v Kev>Um, there have there there
are a couple more that we could
throw


645
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.279
<v Kev>in there if you like.


646
00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:55.359
<v Kev>Would you like to explain,
for example, why at one point he
then


647
00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:59.599
<v Kev>says, Dress up like
Halloween, and ghouls will try to
get.


648
00:21:59.599 --> 00:22:00.480
<v Kev>Your pants.


649
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.759
<v Kev>You got everything for that.


651
00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:07.839
<v Rob>That is left field.


652
00:22:07.839 --> 00:22:12.240
<v Rob>When you started talking
about dress up for Halloween, I was
I was


653
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.799
<v Rob>obviously going to refer back
to some of the fundraising the
school


654
00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:20.000
<v Rob>did, but uh Ghoul's getting
in his pants is a bit of a left
field


655
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.279
<v Rob>um introduction.


656
00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:26.319
<v Rob>I suppose he's he's obviously
he's obviously talking to his new 


657
00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:26.559
<v Rob>love interest.


658
00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:27.519
<v Rob>Of course, of course.


659
00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:30.799
<v Rob>He's uh he's trying to tell
her the problems he's going through,


660
00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:34.960
<v Rob>but it is in the the the the
law, the the the law issues he's got


661
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.839
<v Rob>the legal issues he's got.


662
00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:36.559
<v Rob>So it's a metaphor.


663
00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:43.519
<v Rob>He's trying to tell her that
how much he's struggling without
telling


664
00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:44.720
<v Rob>her he's in witness
protection.


665
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.079
<v Rob>And that is his way of of
expressing his so is he currently
dressing


666
00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:50.799
<v Rob>up like Halloween?


668
00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:55.440
<v Kev>He's always dressing because
he's having in the film, he's just 


669
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.680
<v Kev>constantly dressed up as a
zombie in scene one later, he comes
back


670
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.279
<v Kev>and like a decapitated head.


671
00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:06.079
<v Kev>No, it's just it's just
obviously the the uh is his witness
protection


672
00:23:06.079 --> 00:23:08.079
<v Kev>bit him dressed up like
Halloween.


674
00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.160
<v Rob>Absolutely, I like it.


676
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.119
<v Kev>So you're getting into this
now, and the ghouls that are trying 


677
00:23:13.119 --> 00:23:14.880
<v Kev>to get in in his pack.


679
00:23:15.359 --> 00:23:17.440
<v Rob>Oh, the lawyers who are
coming after him in his career.


680
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.880
<v Rob>He's he is a yeah, you would
feel he's a deep character.


682
00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:21.839
<v Kev>He is a deep character.


683
00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:24.160
<v Kev>He's very deep, John Candy,
in this film.


684
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.839
<v Kev>Probably the deepest role
that John Candy would ever have
played.


686
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.160
<v Rob>I only know Home Alone and
Jurassic Park, so I agree.


688
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:30.799
<v Kev>And cool runnings.


690
00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:33.359
<v Rob>Cool runnings and not
Jurassic Park, as I found out.


692
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.440
<v Kev>Okay, alright.


693
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.640
<v Kev>So that works.


694
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.759
<v Kev>One more then.


695
00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:39.119
<v Kev>And I think this will be
easy.


696
00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:43.759
<v Kev>He does spend a spell of
face-off in a maximum security
prison.


697
00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:46.799
<v Kev>Does he?


698
00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:47.279
<v Kev>He does.


699
00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:53.680
<v Kev>Well, John Candy doesn't
think he's not in it, but but
maximum security.


701
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.680
<v Rob>What do you have to do to go
to maximum security?


703
00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:59.359
<v Kev>It's probably some sort of uh
unspecified financial fraud in the


704
00:23:59.359 --> 00:24:00.240
<v Kev>NHL, I think.


706
00:24:01.759 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Rob>Witness protection worthy.


707
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:08.799
<v Rob>Um so so I I've harked back
to him, the opening scene of him
being


708
00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:12.480
<v Rob>on playing with his uh
playing with the plane and on the
runway.


709
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.519
<v Rob>Well, that's where we
actually start the film, but we do
have flashbacks


710
00:24:15.519 --> 00:24:19.599
<v Rob>to his previous time and part
of his struggles and part of the
depth


711
00:24:19.599 --> 00:24:23.200
<v Rob>of John as a character is
that all the way through he's got
this


712
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.640
<v Rob>real positive surge of energy
coming from the middle school and 


713
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.279
<v Rob>his new love interest, and
everything that's going well in his
life.


715
00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.400
<v Kev>It's really working out.


716
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.119
<v Kev>He's turned a corner.


718
00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:32.079
<v Rob>It's really working out.


719
00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:33.039
<v Rob>He's found his calling.


720
00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:35.039
<v Rob>Absolutely, you'd say so.


721
00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:38.720
<v Rob>Although he still he still
harks back to his days of of
potential


722
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.799
<v Rob>glory and getting to the big
time.


724
00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:43.440
<v Kev>So he still harbours
ambitions to return to the NHL.


726
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.799
<v Rob>Absolutely, but he can never
do that again because of his
situation.


727
00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:50.640
<v Rob>We do get flashbacks uh when
he's really struggling, and I think


728
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.079
<v Rob>he's probably got an
underlying drink problem.


729
00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:53.599
<v Rob>Of course he does.


730
00:24:53.599 --> 00:24:57.519
<v Rob>And when he's when he's had a
bit too many, uh a few too many, uh,


731
00:24:57.519 --> 00:25:01.759
<v Rob>these callbacks to his
previous uh his previous life, and
once he


732
00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Rob>was arrested for his fraud,
he was obviously taken to prison.


733
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.920
<v Rob>And and you as a you as a
viewer, you're watching it thinking,
you


734
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.480
<v Rob>just want him to get better,
uh his mental health, so we can we 


735
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Rob>can really make the most of
his new life down in Phoenix.


737
00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:17.440
<v Kev>Okay, well, I mean I mean I
think that's that you know all fits.


738
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.119
<v Kev>It's a beautiful film we're
constructing here.


739
00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:24.960
<v Kev>I don't think it's much like
the original, um, but that's okay.


740
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.559
<v Kev>I'm not going to ask you to
shoehorn in a chemical weapon that
threatens


741
00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:28.960
<v Kev>LA.


742
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:34.000
<v Kev>Because although we're in the
right sort of part of the USA for 


743
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.200
<v Kev>it, I feel like that might be
a step too far.


744
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.480
<v Kev>Um, I would like to explore
why you think this film would be
called


745
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.039
<v Kev>face off.


746
00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:44.319
<v Kev>I know that I get there's the
ice hockey bit, but presumably
there's


747
00:25:44.319 --> 00:25:46.640
<v Kev>something a bit deeper as to
why it's called face-off.


748
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:52.400
<v Kev>Um it sounds like maybe there
isn't much.


749
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.240
<v Kev>Um I mean, is the court case
unresolved?


750
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.000
<v Kev>Yes, it's ongoing.


751
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.480
<v Kev>So is is the face-off
actually a legal face-off as well?


753
00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:06.400
<v Rob>Um I I actually just prefer
the hockey.


754
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.680
<v Rob>So hockey starting a new
life, start of a new game.


755
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.400
<v Rob>Okay.


757
00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:15.920
<v Kev>Well then so what I suppose
really the next question is how does


758
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.559
<v Kev>this film end?


759
00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:17.359
<v Kev>Like you said.


760
00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:19.599
<v Kev>Like what what are we
building to?


761
00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:23.759
<v Kev>Because generally speaking, a
story has has some form of
resolution,


762
00:26:23.759 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Kev>whether or not it's happy,
that you know, that's that's kind of


763
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.039
<v Kev>by the way, and you're the uh
you're the director here.


764
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:30.160
<v Kev>So what are we building
towards?


766
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.839
<v Rob>And and this film is
heartbreaking.


767
00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:36.000
<v Rob>Oh, is it it's heartbreaking
because we've talked about the
success


768
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.519
<v Rob>he's having all the way
through his new life in Phoenix.


769
00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:44.400
<v Rob>And we know there's an
ongoing court case, and that court
case actually


770
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.440
<v Rob>finds him innocent.


772
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.480
<v Kev>So he didn't he didn't
actually he didn't do any of the
stuff.


774
00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:58.400
<v Rob>And this is the big moral
dilemma on the last on the last
scene,


775
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.119
<v Rob>the last few scenes is his
mini his team's hockey.


776
00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:05.359
<v Rob>Oh no, they haven't reached a
final.


777
00:27:05.359 --> 00:27:06.799
<v Rob>I promise they've reached a
final.


778
00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:09.920
<v Rob>But it's on the same day as
the big trial.


779
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.880
<v Rob>Oh, of course.


780
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.160
<v Rob>And he has got to choose does
he want to continue with his new
life,


781
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.319
<v Rob>little league hockey team,
yeah, his new love interest, or does


782
00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:21.839
<v Rob>he want to go back and clear
his name?


783
00:27:21.839 --> 00:27:22.240
<v Rob>Right.


784
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.680
<v Rob>His one chance to do that.


785
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.200
<v Rob>One chance, one shot, and
potentially get back in the big time
in


786
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:27.359
<v Rob>NHL.


788
00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:29.839
<v Kev>Wow, that's that's quite the
dilemma.


789
00:27:29.839 --> 00:27:31.839
<v Kev>Um, what's what's he gonna
do?


790
00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:34.799
<v Kev>Oh, that's another reason
it's called face-off, then, surely.


791
00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:40.319
<v Kev>Obviously, but you know, it's
it's this, you know, real
head-to-head


792
00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:41.519
<v Kev>dilemma.


794
00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:44.720
<v Rob>He is facing off against his
past.


796
00:27:45.359 --> 00:27:47.759
<v Kev>He is facing off against his
past quite literally.


797
00:27:47.759 --> 00:27:50.400
<v Kev>Right now, I understand where
you've been coming from all along,


798
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.279
<v Kev>Director Rob.


800
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.799
<v Rob>And the twist that nobody saw
coming is that he goes back for the


801
00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:58.319
<v Rob>court case, he's found him to
the city.


802
00:27:58.319 --> 00:28:00.559
<v Rob>Good.


803
00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:02.400
<v Rob>That time, no bloody pitch.


804
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.839
<v Rob>His selfish undertones uh
come through, right?


806
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.119
<v Kev>Well, I mean, we did today,
right?


807
00:28:07.119 --> 00:28:09.920
<v Kev>Well, I mean, you know, that
that quote about all of his loved
ones,


808
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.519
<v Kev>or sorry, all the ones who
love him.


809
00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:11.920
<v Kev>Exactly.


811
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.839
<v Rob>He's not worried about anyone
else.


813
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:14.960
<v Kev>It's all about John.


815
00:28:15.599 --> 00:28:17.920
<v Rob>All about John, and he
ditches them, he leaves into the
final.


816
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.200
<v Rob>They're going to lose, by the
way.


817
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.440
<v Rob>Good.


818
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.640
<v Rob>The community is heartbroken.


819
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.279
<v Rob>He goes back to the big
trial.


820
00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:28.079
<v Rob>Obviously, now everyone else
who was putting him at risk is no
longer


821
00:28:28.079 --> 00:28:28.960
<v Rob>involved and he's found.


822
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Rob>So they go down.


823
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.480
<v Rob>Yeah, they go down, so he
doesn't need to be in witness
protection


824
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:32.799
<v Rob>anymore.


825
00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:34.000
<v Rob>He's found totally innocent.


826
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.160
<v Rob>And never goes back to never
goes back to innocent.


827
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.880
<v Rob>Never goes back to Phoenix.


829
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:38.400
<v Kev>Brutal.


831
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:39.440
<v Rob>Totally forgets.


832
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.400
<v Rob>The love interest.


833
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Rob>Yeah, can't even remember a
name.


835
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.160
<v Kev>The kid who's who he was
playing with a plain runway chase
action


836
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.039
<v Kev>thing right at the start.


837
00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:48.480
<v Kev>Yeah, we don't know what
happens to him.


839
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.839
<v Rob>We do just no further
reference to Phoenix in the whole
film.


841
00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:52.319
<v Kev>Savage.


843
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.680
<v Rob>Does does he Okay?


844
00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.279
<v Rob>He just doesn't care.


845
00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:56.160
<v Rob>He doesn't care.


846
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.079
<v Rob>And actually, we want him to
get better, we want his mental
health


847
00:29:00.079 --> 00:29:02.319
<v Rob>to get better, we want him to
stop drinking, and he does care if


848
00:29:02.319 --> 00:29:04.319
<v Rob>his mental health is loads
better, he stops drinking.


849
00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:09.119
<v Rob>He leaves a trail of
destruction across the whole of
Arizona, but


850
00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:14.559
<v Rob>he gets back to his position
to further his career and be a big 


851
00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:16.079
<v Rob>time hockey coach.


853
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.319
<v Kev>And and are we as the
audience supposed to feel a
particular way


854
00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:23.440
<v Kev>about that, or is that that
really is oh is really the cut
through


855
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.640
<v Kev>the crux of it is the rugged
thing.


857
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.759
<v Rob>The rug has been pulled from
under your feet.


858
00:29:27.759 --> 00:29:32.000
<v Rob>You've gone from wanting him
to be a success, wanting the best
room,


859
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.160
<v Rob>and really thinking that he's
going to make the most of it with 


860
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.799
<v Rob>Phoenix to not caring what
happens to him.


861
00:29:36.799 --> 00:29:42.000
<v Rob>And it is about the cutthroat
reality of being a top elite sports


862
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.880
<v Rob>coach in the US.


864
00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.799
<v Kev>That was what it was all
about, really.


866
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.440
<v Rob>That's what it's all about,
and a little bit about Phoenix.


868
00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:51.359
<v Kev>And some children are getting
heartbroken along the way.


869
00:29:51.359 --> 00:29:52.480
<v Kev>Well, okay.


870
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.279
<v Kev>Um, well, I think we've sort
of reached the the the kind of the 


871
00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:59.599
<v Kev>point where where we've
effectively lost the plot.


873
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.240
<v Rob>Uh tell me that's not like
every sports film in Hollywood
you've


874
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.640
<v Rob>ever seen.


876
00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:08.799
<v Kev>Well, it's it's quite
derivative in a number of areas, but
I feel


877
00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Kev>like the ending, I mean, he's
gone and he's cleared his name and


878
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.680
<v Kev>he's left the team.


879
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.480
<v Kev>He doesn't reappear at the
11th hour for kind of a in the final


880
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.720
<v Kev>period he turns up and
they're all looking his way and
they're pleased


881
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.440
<v Kev>or anything like that.


882
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:21.680
<v Kev>Nope.


883
00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.960
<v Kev>They maybe they keep looking
for him, and we're expecting as an 


884
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.519
<v Kev>audience, we're expecting him
to walk in the tunnel, but instead


885
00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:28.400
<v Kev>he's just gone to the bar.


887
00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:29.759
<v Rob>No, I don't know.


888
00:30:29.759 --> 00:30:33.759
<v Rob>There's I like that, and then
actually he's is just at an NHL
game.


889
00:30:33.759 --> 00:30:39.119
<v Rob>Yeah, just sitting he's been
shmoozed by the CEO of some uh
hockey


890
00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:40.640
<v Rob>team and he's gonna get his
job back.


891
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.400
<v Rob>Nice, hot dog on a beer, sat
back.


892
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.839
<v Rob>And that the only time the
people from Phoenix ever see him
again


893
00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:46.480
<v Rob>is on the TV.


895
00:30:47.119 --> 00:30:47.519
<v Kev>Wow, brutal.


897
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.000
<v Kev>Yeah.


898
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.359
<v Kev>So, well, as I said,
derivative in many ways, but I think
the ending


899
00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:55.119
<v Kev>probably wouldn't be a
classic sort of happy ending there.


900
00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:57.839
<v Kev>But I quite like the way
you've reimagined face off.


901
00:30:57.839 --> 00:31:02.799
<v Kev>I suppose now it comes down
to the scoring, which starts with
this.


902
00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:06.880
<v Kev>We did talk about the three
particular areas where we'd be
scoring,


903
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.160
<v Kev>and they were coherence.


904
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:13.039
<v Kev>I mean, it it does actually
plausibly fit together quite nicely.


906
00:31:13.759 --> 00:31:14.559
<v Rob>There is no plot holes.


907
00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:15.680
<v Rob>Name one plot hole.


909
00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:17.759
<v Kev>Name one plot hole.


910
00:31:17.759 --> 00:31:21.599
<v Kev>I mean, the the the ghouls in
your pants Halloween bit is a bit 


911
00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:21.599
<v Kev>tenuous.


912
00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:26.160
<v Kev>I'm really not sure about the
made-up plain start because that
that


913
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.799
<v Kev>that feels like it belongs in
a story where actually he does end


914
00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:34.799
<v Kev>up having some value or
meaning for the child.


916
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.599
<v Rob>Or a reference to the ghouls
in his past.


918
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.880
<v Kev>Yeah, I can I get that.


919
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.920
<v Kev>He just misread the script.


921
00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:42.799
<v Rob>He just misread the script.


923
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.640
<v Kev>It was nothing to do with
ghouls trying to get into your
pants.


924
00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.799
<v Kev>It was the ghouls trying to
get into your past.


926
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:49.359
<v Rob>Thank you.


928
00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.000
<v Kev>There we go.


929
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.119
<v Kev>That clarifies that.


930
00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:53.440
<v Kev>Well, in which case the
coherence score can shoot right up.


931
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.039
<v Kev>Um I I think you did a very
good job actually of shoehorning in 


932
00:31:57.039 --> 00:31:57.920
<v Kev>a whole bunch of different
things.


933
00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.759
<v Kev>I did pick some quite
friendly elements.


935
00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:01.279
<v Rob>15-minute plane battle.


937
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.240
<v Kev>Yeah, well, you know.


938
00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.559
<v Kev>But also, that's why I feel
that it lacks a bit of coherence
because


939
00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:08.720
<v Kev>I just don't see that they
would have had a 15-minute section
of


940
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.720
<v Kev>that in the film if it was
really such a trivial part.


941
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.319
<v Kev>So I'm going to score you six
for coherence.


942
00:32:12.319 --> 00:32:13.440
<v Kev>Out of what?


943
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.960
<v Kev>Uh 10.


944
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.359
<v Kev>Everything's going to be
arbitrary out of.


945
00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:19.279
<v Kev>I don't know what I'm going
to no, I'm going to make it seven.


946
00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:21.599
<v Kev>I'll give you seven for
coherence on it.


947
00:32:21.599 --> 00:32:25.680
<v Kev>Because actually, there was
there was a there was a redemption
arc.


948
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.960
<v Kev>It didn't end quite how I
expected.


949
00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.079
<v Kev>Um, but that's good.


950
00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:29.279
<v Kev>Entertainment factor.


951
00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:32.160
<v Kev>It depends on how good the
action scene is at the start, to be
honest.


952
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.720
<v Kev>Um I think uh Rubbish, okay.


953
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.400
<v Kev>Well, you haven't really
solved it.


954
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.319
<v Kev>Um what about the the sort of
it is it an emotional tugs at the 


955
00:32:40.319 --> 00:32:41.920
<v Kev>heartstrings in the in the
main element of it?


956
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.279
<v Kev>I can see that it would be
quite uh emotionally engaging
watching


957
00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:46.319
<v Kev>his redemption arc.


959
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.559
<v Rob>I think you're
underestimating the fun that could
be have that could


960
00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:55.200
<v Rob>be had fundraising for a new
hockey rink and the I think that
would


961
00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.880
<v Rob>be a very dry butt mini
montage uh fundraising fundraising
and selling


962
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.720
<v Rob>cookies from the back of uh
schoolyards and stuff like that.


964
00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:08.799
<v Kev>Okay, I I would have thought
maybe the the montages would maybe 


965
00:33:08.799 --> 00:33:11.119
<v Kev>be more ice hockey based and
about no, there's there's actually 


966
00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:13.839
<v Kev>very little of hockey than I
didn't really see any of the game.


968
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.960
<v Rob>Yeah, they don't I'm I'm not
even sure they raise the funds for 


969
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.519
<v Rob>a rink.


971
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.599
<v Kev>How do they make it to the
final?


972
00:33:19.599 --> 00:33:21.440
<v Kev>Let's not worry about how
they make it to the final because
that's


973
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.440
<v Kev>we're just gonna lose
coherence if we if we do that.


974
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.559
<v Kev>Entertainment factors.


975
00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:29.359
<v Kev>You have lowered that
massively by focusing on the
sponsorship angle.


976
00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:31.519
<v Kev>So, entertainment factor, I'm
going with five.


977
00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Kev>And you're and you're lucky
to get five, frankly.


978
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.839
<v Kev>Um, originality.


980
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.640
<v Rob>Oh, can I score this?


981
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.759
<v Rob>Go on, because I've watched
very few films, and this is.


982
00:33:41.759 --> 00:33:43.359
<v Rob>And all of them are
referenced in this one.


983
00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:47.599
<v Rob>All of them are referenced in
this one, and it is a solid three.


984
00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:51.519
<v Rob>There is nothing in there
that hasn't happened in Hollywood
before.


986
00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:54.559
<v Kev>Well, no, but I mean we're
we're not gonna hold you to that
sort


987
00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:54.880
<v Kev>of start.


988
00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.920
<v Kev>You know, I don't think
you're gonna have to be any any sort
of 


989
00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.039
<v Kev>Guillermo del Toro.


990
00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Kev>Not that you know that
doesn't matter.


991
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.440
<v Kev>Okay, well, I would I'll I'll
give you four for original just
because


992
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.119
<v Kev>the curveball at the end
where he never goes back.


993
00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:09.440
<v Kev>You we're expecting, you
know, if it follows the standard
tropes


994
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.360
<v Kev>of a kind of sports coach
little league kind of thing, he goes
back


995
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.000
<v Kev>and they win the game
somehow, or at least he goes back
and consoles


996
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.960
<v Kev>them and they all learn a
lesson, but instead he just cuts
them 


997
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:18.960
<v Kev>off.


998
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.280
<v Kev>Um which is brutal, but I but
quite original.


999
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.840
<v Kev>Um so let's let's hit that
for a five.


1000
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.639
<v Kev>A five?


1001
00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:25.360
<v Kev>Yeah, five.


1002
00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.400
<v Kev>What's in total?


1003
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.320
<v Kev>Uh I've already forgotten
what the other numbers were.


1004
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:28.559
<v Kev>Brilliant.


1005
00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:32.320
<v Kev>Adherence, I think maybe
seven entertainment five and
originality


1006
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:32.800
<v Kev>five.


1007
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.440
<v Kev>So you've got seventeen.


1008
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.480
<v Kev>I say we're for half marks.


1009
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.920
<v Kev>That is 17 out of 30.


1010
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.880
<v Kev>A high bar.


1011
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.280
<v Kev>It is well, it's it's a
generous bar.


1012
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.320
<v Kev>We'll call it a generous bar.


1013
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Kev>For next week, it's it's
gonna get we're doing this again.


1014
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.320
<v Kev>Uh well, maybe how many films
do you know about?


1015
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.920
<v Kev>I know about quite a few.


1016
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.719
<v Kev>The real question is how many
films could I find that you don't 


1017
00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:51.599
<v Kev>know enough about, I suppose.


1018
00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:52.320
<v Kev>A lot.


1019
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.559
<v Kev>Um the the next one,
actually, on my mind, and I don't
know how 


1020
00:34:56.559 --> 00:34:58.559
<v Kev>much you know about this
film, is a film called Goodwill
Hunting.


1021
00:34:58.559 --> 00:35:02.239
<v Kev>Any any sort of knowledge of
that?


1023
00:35:02.639 --> 00:35:03.280
<v Rob>I've got no knowledge.


1025
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.000
<v Kev>Okay, perfect.


1026
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.840
<v Kev>So that's what I've got an
initial reaction.


1027
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.480
<v Kev>Oh.


1028
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.639
<v Kev>Would you care to share any
of that?


1029
00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:10.639
<v Kev>Do you want to know my
initial reaction to that?


1030
00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:11.679
<v Kev>Or should we save that?


1031
00:35:11.679 --> 00:35:12.719
<v Kev>We'll save that for next
time.


1032
00:35:12.719 --> 00:35:14.880
<v Kev>We'll save that for next
time, otherwise people will think
it's 


1033
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.480
<v Kev>all scripted and we wouldn't
want that, would we?


1034
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.880
<v Kev>Um at least that's what it
says in the script here.


1035
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.440
<v Kev>Right, okay, so I think we've
we've covered face off um in the no


1036
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.880
<v Kev>context cinema club, and I I
really quite enjoyed it.


1037
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.800
<v Kev>So 17 out of 30, not a bad
start to your directorial career.


1039
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.559
<v Rob>I mean, that is what top 50
on IMDB must be.


1041
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.079
<v Kev>You know about IMDb, do you?


1043
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.360
<v Rob>Yeah, I googled it before.


1045
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.599
<v Kev>Okay, excellent.


1046
00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:41.519
<v Kev>Love that.


1047
00:35:41.519 --> 00:35:43.039
<v Kev>Okay, right.


1048
00:35:43.039 --> 00:35:46.400
<v Kev>So we will uh we'll call
we'll call an end to face off then.


1050
00:35:46.639 --> 00:35:46.639
<v Rob>Okay.


1052
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.760
<v Kev>Um, and thank you very much.


1053
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.559
<v Kev>We'll see you next time.


1054
00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:49.280
<v Kev>See you later.


1056
00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.400
<v Rob>So, Kev.


1057
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.039
<v Rob>Now, we've just spent the
last half an hour or so talking
about 


1058
00:35:57.039 --> 00:35:58.719
<v Rob>my lack of knowledge about
films.


1059
00:35:58.719 --> 00:36:02.079
<v Rob>But I I actually think my
lack of knowledge about films is
just 


1060
00:36:02.079 --> 00:36:04.880
<v Rob>is just because I've just not
got any interest in films as such.


1061
00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.280
<v Rob>Okay.


1062
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.599
<v Rob>So I think it's just a normal
lack of knowledge.


1063
00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:08.719
<v Rob>It's not special.


1064
00:36:08.719 --> 00:36:09.840
<v Rob>I don't know.


1066
00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:16.639
<v Kev>I would argue it's it's a gap
in pretty pretty mainstream pop
culture.


1068
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.400
<v Rob>I disagree.


1069
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.559
<v Rob>I I don't think many people
know about FaceOff.


1071
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.400
<v Kev>I I well, okay.


1072
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.920
<v Kev>We'll maybe we'll find that
out.


1074
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.320
<v Rob>So so anyway, I I think my
lack of knowledge will be subsequent


1075
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.039
<v Rob>to your lack of knowledge in
in some pretty pop culture things.


1076
00:36:31.039 --> 00:36:31.840
<v Rob>Okay, alright.


1077
00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:36.400
<v Rob>So I I've begged you for a
section at the end of the podcast to


1078
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.280
<v Rob>try and I don't know exactly
what the section is going to be.


1079
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.400
<v Rob>And it's gonna be unscripted.


1080
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.320
<v Rob>Okay, well, good.


1081
00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.039
<v Rob>Yeah, good.


1082
00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:45.920
<v Rob>And it's gonna be different
probably every time we do it.


1083
00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.400
<v Rob>Okay.


1084
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.920
<v Rob>But I've got a little quiz
for you about something which I
think


1085
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.880
<v Rob>is incredibly popular, which
I don't think you'll know about.


1086
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.920
<v Rob>Okay, all right.


1087
00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.280
<v Rob>And that's Doctor Who.


1088
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.519
<v Rob>Uh okay then, yes, you're
correct.


1089
00:36:57.519 --> 00:37:01.920
<v Rob>So I've got three questions
which I think have entered the
public


1090
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.760
<v Rob>consciousness in the last two
decades.


1092
00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:07.840
<v Kev>Okay, so 20 years of Doctor
Who distilled to three questions.


1094
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.480
<v Rob>I think Doctor Who rebooted
in 2007.


1095
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.599
<v Rob>Not sure.


1096
00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:13.519
<v Rob>A lot of people will probably
disagree with that.


1098
00:37:14.239 --> 00:37:15.039
<v Kev>It might have been a bit
earlier than that.


1099
00:37:15.039 --> 00:37:16.880
<v Kev>Was it Christopher Eccleston
playing the doctor?


1100
00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.800
<v Kev>I'm worried that you know
that.


1102
00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:22.639
<v Rob>He is not one of my
questions.


1103
00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:24.400
<v Rob>Okay, well, good, good, good.


1104
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Rob>But I reckon over the last
two decades or so, these three
things


1105
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.679
<v Rob>have entered public
consciousness.


1106
00:37:29.679 --> 00:37:30.400
<v Rob>Okay.


1107
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.400
<v Rob>And I want I want to
basically prove to you that you've
got as much


1108
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.719
<v Rob>of a gap with TV shows as I
do with films.


1109
00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:37.119
<v Rob>Alright.


1110
00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:40.559
<v Rob>Just in three questions, I'm
not gonna make you write a whole
plot.


1111
00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:43.039
<v Rob>So, question one, and this is
multiple choice.


1112
00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:44.000
<v Rob>Oh, okay.


1113
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.519
<v Rob>Well, do I do I have to have
the options?


1114
00:37:45.519 --> 00:37:46.480
<v Rob>I will give you the options.


1115
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.119
<v Rob>Okay, alright.


1116
00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:50.800
<v Rob>Um, what is the name of the
doctor's time machine?


1117
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.840
<v Rob>You don't have to have the
options.


1118
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.800
<v Rob>That's the TARDIS.


1119
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.599
<v Rob>Oh, worrying.


1120
00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:57.440
<v Rob>So that no is it you would
think I would not know that.


1121
00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.800
<v Rob>They get more difficult.


1122
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.880
<v Rob>I knew you'd know that.


1124
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:01.599
<v Kev>Good, of course.


1125
00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:02.400
<v Kev>It's an easy warm up.


1126
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.840
<v Kev>What were your options that
you'd written for that?


1128
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:04.880
<v Rob>Don't worry about that.


1129
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.960
<v Rob>TARDIS, TADAS, and TADAS.


1130
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:12.719
<v Rob>Okay, um, so that's question
one.


1131
00:38:12.719 --> 00:38:13.440
<v Rob>So you have a base.


1132
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.360
<v Rob>Do you know what TANDIS
stands for?


1133
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.400
<v Rob>Of course I do.


1134
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.320
<v Rob>Time and relative dimensions.


1135
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.559
<v Rob>Oh, dimensions in space, is
it?


1137
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.440
<v Kev>Alright, there we go.


1138
00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.119
<v Kev>So that's Are you worried
now?


1139
00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:24.079
<v Kev>I'm a little bit worried.


1141
00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:25.840
<v Rob>We got close.


1143
00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:26.800
<v Kev>Five out of six don't matter.


1145
00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:29.440
<v Rob>I'm glad I'm glad that um
question two is a little bit more
difficult.


1146
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:34.239
<v Rob>So in Matt Smith's first
episode of The Doctor, what bizarre
food


1147
00:38:34.239 --> 00:38:36.880
<v Rob>combination is he craving
during his regeneration?


1148
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.360
<v Rob>I've got I've got multiple
choices.


1150
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Kev>Yeah, I'm gonna need that.


1152
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.079
<v Rob>So is it apple pie and gravy?


1153
00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:46.159
<v Rob>Oh fish fingers and custard,
or pancakes and tomato soup.


1155
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.000
<v Kev>Okay, that is this is gonna
be pure guesswork, but it's a
British


1156
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.400
<v Kev>film.


1157
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.440
<v Kev>Well the officers.


1158
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.159
<v Kev>I'm sorry, a British TV
series, you're right, yeah.


1160
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.480
<v Rob>Apple pie and gravy, fish
fingers and custard, or pancakes
with 


1161
00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:58.880
<v Rob>tomato soup.


1163
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.800
<v Kev>Well, if it's a little curve
ball thrown in for the American
audience,


1164
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.000
<v Kev>because I think I'm right in
saying that they talk about biscuits


1165
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.400
<v Kev>and gravy or gravy and
biscuits, and that's like an apple
thing 


1166
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.760
<v Kev>with not gravy with something
else, but that's what Americans call


1167
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:13.920
<v Kev>it.


1168
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.880
<v Kev>So I'm gonna take that.


1169
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.079
<v Kev>And you are very wrong.


1171
00:39:16.559 --> 00:39:16.800
<v Rob>Ah crap.


1172
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.480
<v Rob>Which is great for me because
it proves my point.


1174
00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.960
<v Kev>Well, it That's a bit niche,
but alright.


1176
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.800
<v Rob>It's not so it's fish,
fingers, and custard.


1178
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.199
<v Kev>Right, and and how has that
entered the collective conversation?


1179
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:30.960
<v Kev>How many people if if I went
up to them in the street and said
uh,


1180
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.519
<v Kev>what did Matt Smith crave
when in his first episode
regenerating


1181
00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:36.800
<v Kev>as Doctor Who?


1183
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.519
<v Rob>How many people, if you
walked to talk to them on the street
and


1184
00:39:39.519 --> 00:39:42.320
<v Rob>asked them about face-off,
would be able to quote or or
reference


1185
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:42.880
<v Rob>it?


1187
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.039
<v Kev>I think way more than we
would see on the street.


1188
00:39:45.039 --> 00:39:47.199
<v Kev>This is a good conjecture,
isn't it?


1190
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:47.440
<v Rob>Yeah.


1191
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:52.639
<v Rob>So so that is if you go on
Etsy, by the way, and search Doctor
Who,


1192
00:39:52.639 --> 00:39:54.639
<v Rob>you can get Fish, Fingers,
and Custard on everything.


1193
00:39:54.639 --> 00:39:55.519
<v Rob>Oh, okay, alright.


1194
00:39:55.519 --> 00:39:56.480
<v Rob>So it's a thing.


1195
00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.119
<v Rob>It's not just me.


1196
00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:58.239
<v Rob>Fish, fingers, and custard.


1197
00:39:58.239 --> 00:39:59.599
<v Rob>It's quite a big thing.


1198
00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:02.400
<v Rob>So question three, and this
is the last one, it's multiple
choice


1199
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:02.719
<v Rob>again.


1200
00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:08.239
<v Rob>So this is around the highest
rated episode on of Doctor Who
according


1201
00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.440
<v Rob>to IMDB users.


1202
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.199
<v Rob>Call back to before.


1203
00:40:11.199 --> 00:40:12.320
<v Rob>This is when I had to Google
IMDb.


1204
00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.480
<v Rob>That's why you're on IMDb,
then.


1205
00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Rob>So um the Doctor, this is a
question about the highest rated
episode.


1206
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.360
<v Rob>So the doctor sends a cryptic
message back through time to help 


1207
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.920
<v Rob>his friends survive an
encounter with the weeping angels.


1208
00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.159
<v Rob>What is his key instruction?


1209
00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:30.320
<v Rob>Is it stay in the light?


1210
00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.159
<v Rob>Is it avoid mirrors, or is it
don't blink?


1212
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.719
<v Kev>Or weeping angels.


1213
00:40:36.719 --> 00:40:38.159
<v Kev>Stay in the light.


1214
00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:41.039
<v Kev>I can believe that would
work.


1215
00:40:41.039 --> 00:40:42.559
<v Kev>Avoid mirrors.


1216
00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:43.519
<v Kev>Avoid mirrors.


1217
00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:48.639
<v Kev>And the third one's blink.


1218
00:40:48.639 --> 00:40:49.519
<v Kev>Don't blink.


1219
00:40:49.519 --> 00:40:51.920
<v Kev>Weeping angels.


1220
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.000
<v Kev>I will go with stay in the
light, please.


1222
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Rob>And again, you're wrong.


1223
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.880
<v Rob>This is great news for me.


1224
00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.360
<v Rob>Terrible.


1225
00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.840
<v Rob>So I got 17 out of 30, which
was way over 50%, and you've got one


1226
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.360
<v Rob>out of three, which is under
50%.


1227
00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.039
<v Rob>So I think it's kind of
proved my point that my knowledge
isn't 


1228
00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:12.559
<v Rob>as bad as potentially you
think it is.


1230
00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:17.760
<v Kev>Well, I think that our
lengthy exploration of face off
suggests 


1231
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:17.760
<v Kev>otherwise.


1232
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.599
<v Kev>But we can find out next time
when by the sounds of it, we might


1233
00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:23.519
<v Kev>be exploring Goodwill Hunting
instead.


1234
00:41:23.519 --> 00:41:25.119
<v Kev>I am looking forward to it.


1235
00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:25.440
<v Kev>Excellent.


1236
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.960
<v Kev>Well, thank you very much for
your time.


1237
00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.440
<v Kev>Bye.
